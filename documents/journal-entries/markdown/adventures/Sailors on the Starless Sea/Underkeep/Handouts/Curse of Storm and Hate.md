Heroes escaping the tomb with either @Item[Felan's Axe] or @Item[Felan's Armor] are subject to two last wards: the curse of storm and hate. 

Judges are encouraged to create their own curse, specific to their home campaign. Following are some sample curses to serve as inspiration:

- The next time the PCs are at sea, their ship is overtaken by
a fearsome storm. Just as their ship is torn asunder, the heroes
see an image of Felan, silhouetted in the heart of the
clouds. To survive the PCs must make it to a jungle island,
where ancient reptiles lie in wait.
- The wielder of @Item[Felan's Axe] is slowly overcome by his
passions. At the judgeâ€™s choosing (at least once per adventure)
the wielder must succeed on a **DC 15 Will save** or
succumb to a violent rage, mindlessly attacking his foes
and savagely pursuing them to the death.
- The next time the PCs are traveling through the wilderness,
they are overtaken by towering thunderclouds on
an otherwise clear day. Just before the rain starts to fall,
the PCs spy the silhouette of Felan in the heart of the roiling
black clouds. Then comes the lightning. Each PC that
entered the tomb is attacked by a bolt of lightning: Atk
lightning bolt +1 missile fire; dmg 2d10.
