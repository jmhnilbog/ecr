# Sailors on the Starless Sea

## Introduction

***This adventure is designed for 10 to 15 0-level characters, or a much smaller
party of 1st and 2nd level characters aided by hirelings. In playtest groups of
15 0-level PCs, 7 or 8 typically survive.***

*Bent on stopping the rash of abductions plaguing their village, the characters
discover a horde of vile beastmen inhabiting the ancient keep on the hill.
Seeking the source of these abominations, the PCs uncover an ancient chaos cult
and its source: an antediluvian ziggurat set in the center of a vast, 
underground sea. There, at the font of chaos, the PCs witness a wicked rite
culminating in the sacrifice of their fellow villagers. If the PCs can interrupt
the rite before its conclusion and stave off the rebirth of the legendary chaos
lord, they stand a chance of escaping the underworld alive. But if their courage
or luck should fail them, the PCs will suffer a fate more fearsome than death, 
their spirits fueling the infernal might of the reborn chaos lord.*

## Background   
 
::: dm-only
Ages past, innumerable chaos cults flourished on the edge of civilization. For
each holy spire rising to extol the virtues of goodness and law, there was an 
infernal reflection, offering mankind material power and wealth in exchange for
cruel acts and bloody sacrifice. Humanity was a young and foolish race, and many
a prince and peon sold his soul in exchange for power over his foeman. But as
civilization endured, uniting tribes into clans and clans into kingdoms, slowly
the light of law beat back the chaos.

Not to be outdone, the powers of chaos and evil sought out champions of profound
wickedness and cruelty, mortals possessed of the strength of will to lead the 
hordes of chaos against the armies of the enemy.

These champions were the chaos lords.

The brothers **Molan** and **Felan** were two such champions. Vicious and cunning beyond
measure, and without a scrap of mercy in their war-hardened hearts, they led
hordes of bestial humanoids to victory against the armies of good. With the
spoils of their bloody campaigns, they raised a mighty keep and rained terror
and violence down upon all in their demesne.

In the end, the brothersâ€™ success was their undoing. Disparate forces of men, 
dwarves, and elves rallied together in a crusade against the wicked chaos lords.
For thirty-nine days, the allies laid siege to the foul keep. And on the
fortieth day, the captain of the elves dealt Felan a mortal blow. **Realizing that
his own end was drawing near, Molan retreated into the ancient caves beneath the
keep. First the chaos lord entombed his brother in a hidden crypt, defended by
no less than four curses. Then, as the armies of good laid waste to the keep, 
Molan gave up his mortal shell, commending his damned soul into the writhing
limbs of the gods of Chaos.**

**Molan made only one request. When ages had passed, and the armies of good fell
into disarray once more, he asked to return and lay waste to his ancient foes.**

***That time has come.***
