# The road to the keep is overrun with weeds...and horror!
::: summary

#### Summary

The two bodies here are @Token[Keary] and Alban, children of the village blacksmith. They have been changed into @Actor[Vine Horror]{Vine Horrors}, which spill thousands of horrid @Actor[Awful Seeds] when dispatched.

They have a pitiful amount of treasure on them.

An old **dirt road**, now **overrun with weeds** and sickly vines, rises
towards the ruined citadel. A grisly sight bars your way: **a pair of bodies, 
secured to poles** by long ropey vines. The wicked **vines have wormed their way
inside** the bodiesâ€™ eyes, ears, and mouths.

Should they approach further, show the @JournalEntry[Bodies on the Causeway] handout, then...

::: readaloud
To your horror, *you realize the
bodies are still moving*!

 The vines unwind from the posts, freeing the
horrors to shamble toward the PCs. 

**Any PC from the village that gets a good look at the corpses recognizes them as the village blacksmith's children, Keary and Alban.** The brothers vanished from the village eleven days
ago. The beastmen killed the brothers and seeded their corpses
with vine horrors to ward off any investigations from the
townsfolk.

The bodies fall apart upon 'death', releasing piles of @Actor[Awful Seeds]. They hold a tiny amount of treasure as described in the summary above.
