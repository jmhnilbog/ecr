The keep’s **massive wall has collapsed here**, spilling cyclopean stone blocks down the rocky slope. The blocks are **precariously balanced** atop one another, like a titan’s game of dice. 
::: 

Several of the blocks are poised to shift if disturbed. Those
ascending the slope without noting the danger inevitably trigger a slide. One
false step and massive granite blocks tumble down the slope, crushing all in
their path...

Clouds of choking dust fill the air along with the screams of the
dying and the deafening crash of stone against stone.

::: statblock trap
Unstable Rubble: Atk avalanche +5 melee
([[/r 1d10]]); SP Detectable, Triggerable, AOE, Destruction, LOUD, Reveal.

Detectable
    : **The trap is safe if detected and triggered if not detected.**
    : Miners and dwarves **AUTOMATICALLY CHECK DC 8 INT** to recognize the unstable stones.
    : **DC 10 INT** for all others.

Triggerable
    : Miners and dwarves can trigger the avalanche safely with a **DC 10 STR** check from the top of the pile.
    : **DC 20 STR** for all others.
    : Attempts to trigger the avalanche *unsafely* automatically succeed.

AOE
    : Every character on or below the rubble is subject to the avalanche attack when triggered. (+

Destruction
    : All items carried by creatures killed by the avalanche are destroyed.

LOUD
    : Surprise is out of the question and immediately roll for a Random Encounter.

Reveal
    : Any search of the rubble after the avalanche has been triggered locates a narrow, rocky shaft descending 14 feet to the @JournalEntry[Tomb of the Fallen].

:::

If the trap is triggered, there's no way the party is surprising anyone. Some beastmen may investigate.


The trap can be triggered by the @Actor[Trap Triggerer!]
