The dark, moss-eaten gatehouse towers
above you, grim and forbidding. Murder holes, fashioned in the likeness
of looming toads, threaten to gout forth flaming oil and tar.
Black arrow slits pierce the high stone walls. You can hear the flap
of the heretical banner above, hidden from sight by the vine-draped
battlements.
The ancient drawbridge has long since fallen away into ruin, leaving
only a few rotting planks placed across the ditch. The heavy iron
portcullis stands half-raised, the rusty spikes a mere four feet above
slots cut into the stone floor.

Two snarling beastmen lurk on the second floor of the gatehouse
(accessible only from area H). Cautious PCs pausing to
listen will hear animal-like sniffing sounds and the scratch of
claws on stone coming from above.
The beastmen wait for the PCs to enter, then drop the portcullis
on the last rank (Atk portcullis -5 melee; Dmg 1d6/round).
A hero pinned by the portcullis takes ongoing damage each
round until he dies or is freed (DC 23 Str check; alternately, 4
characters lifting together can hoist the portcullis if their combined
Str exceeds 40).
After dropping the portcullis, the beastmen toll a great bell.
This alerts their brothers to the PCsâ€™ presence. Their work
done, the howling beastmen withdraw to area H.
