# Player Start

## Rumors &amp; Superstitions

The keep looming high on the hill has long been a source of fearsome tales and
terrible legends. The locals are steeped in superstitious lore surrounding the
keep; some of the tales ring with truth while others are misleading wivesâ€™ tales
or the fanciful mumblings of a town drunk.

It is up to the players to sort the truth from the lies, for while the rumors
offer valuable clues, they can also lure foolish characters to their doom.

**Before beginning the adventure, give each player a rumor from:** @RollTable[rQURZa8FCeWZrCjZ]{Rumors &amp; Superstitions}

::: summary
The keep ahead has several entrances. Check the @JournalEntry[Sailors On The Starless Sea: Overview] first for notes on character creation an rumor distribution.

Play progresses from here to the @Scene[4AqdgBmbkOW8F02y]{Underkeep}, entering at either the @JournalEntry[AA9cD4YblGF5wUUN]{Tomb of the Fallen} or @JournalEntry[o4x4mf3MFy4PviP9]{Trail of Gold}.

You stand before the ruined keep, which squats atop a low, craggy
hill, its walls of toppled stone and **massive granite blocks** hinting at forgotten
battles and the clash of mighty armies. Now the ruins seem host only to **creeping
vines** and the **foul miasma** that drifts down from the keep.

The air is overrun with pestilence. **Fat flies bite at you** incessantly, and
**clouds of small black insects** choke your every breath. The long abandoned land
is choked with **thorny vines** that drape the sickly trees and hang from the ruined
walls. There is an **odor of rot and decay**, as if the hill itself were decomposing
from within.

A sight gives you pause: **a ragged banner, depicting a crimson skull on a black
field**, stands high atop the ruined walls. Whatever lurks within has terrorized
you and your village for far too long. You turn to your companions and ready
your meager weapons. The time for retribution has come.

## Approaching the Ruins

The PCs are free to enter as they see fit.

::: aside
**A Ticking Clock?**

The adventure assumes that PCs will have a difficult enough time simply surviving until the end, but the Judge may wish to introduce time pressure as well. In that case, be sure to keep track of elapsed turns during play. The ritual continues at the ziggurat until the PCs interrupt it or dawn approaches at about (4:00am). The PCs arrive at mid-afternoon, about 3:00pm, if they elect to travel the causeway. Other approaches delay them until 5:00pm.
:::

| Approach | Details |
|--|--
| Up the road, from the south | This, the most obvious approach, takes them up the causeway (@Compendium[ecr.sotss-journals.The Devil's Causeway]). This is also the most dangerous. Wily characters will be rewarded for their suspicion, though hesitation should never be mistaken for caution. |
| Through the crumbled wall, from the west | Part of the wall has crumbled, and entering this way requires the characters to ascend the rubble (LINK TO AREA B). Picking their way through the fallen blocks is not difficult, but carries its own risks as noted below. |
| Across the sinkhole, from the northeast | A lot of chutzpa and a lot of rope are needed to get past the smoking pit. (LINK TO AREA G) |
| Climbing the walls elsewhere | Each character must succeed on a **DC 15 climb check** or fall 20 feet for **[[/r 2d6]] damage**. Each *6* rolled results in a broken bone. |
