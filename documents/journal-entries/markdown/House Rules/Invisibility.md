  Regarding Invisibility
  : Invisible creatures *usually* receive **+2 to attacks and are difficult to locate.** These bonuses are reduced or eliminated against creatures not visually-oriented.
  : Illusions or mental affects that mask the presence of an item or creature are ***not*** invisibility.
  : Visible **light travels through invisible creatures** without affecting them in any way. 
  : If the correct location of an invisible creature is targeted by an attack, it may be attacked normally, but **a miss chance of up to 50% is applied** on otherwise successful attacks.
    
    | Miss Chance | Example Circumstances |
    |--|--|
    | 0% | An explosion larger that the guessed location; a successful **Mighty Deed** |
    | 10% | The attack of a giant naked mole rat; a powerful blind swordsman's attack |
    | 25% | A cloud of flour gives away the outline of the invisible creature; the attack of a blind ooze |
    | 50% | Normal attacks without mitigating circumstances |
