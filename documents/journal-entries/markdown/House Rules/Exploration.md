# Regarding Exploration

## Searching
It only takes a character a minute to perform a cursory search of a 20x20 room, revealing obvious things and potentially triggering traps. The character can roll any automatic chances to detect secret doors or similar.
It takes 30 minutes to really look at the same area. The character has normal Find/Detect Traps chances, and so on.
It takes a character an hour to make a complete search of a 20x20 room, revealing everything possible about the area, noticing and avoiding any traps, and discovering any secret doors and operating mechanisms present.
Characters can work together to search the same area faster or a larger area in the same time.

## Maps
Maps are useful when accurate and horrible when not so. Parties following an accurate map of an indoor or small-scale map will not make wrong turns if travelling with **Cautious** or **Normal Movement**, and they keep an accurate mental map of travel at those paces. A skilled cartographer may create or keep a paper map updated when moving at those paces.
Mental maps are only useful for ground covered in the previous few days before becoming inaccurate. Inexpertly made paper maps require a skill check whenever they are added to in order to avoid inaccuracy.

Luck checks are required when following inaccurate maps. Any decision point or obvious error requires a check. Failure causes the party to make a wrong turn, success allows a correct turn (or the best possible turn if wrong turns have lead the party astray already) and notifies the party of the map's inaccuracy when the next check would be required.

## Movement While Exploring Dangerous Locales

Characters' movement within combat is defined by their Move scores and Encumbrance. Outside of combat--exploring their world or fleeing haphazardly from the foes that dwell in it--they move at different speeds. Players are free to choose any of these types of movement when out of combat. You are likely to be asked to calculate Encumbrance before choosing Rushed Movement, and should start dropping heavy things!

**Cautious Movement** is slow and steady. When moving cautiously, characters will not activate traps simply by passing through an area. The party will discover evidence of any such trap before it can trigger. Any chance to detect the presence of secret doors when searching will trigger automatically, and they will not be surprised by any ambush they encounter. Areas the party has traveled through at this pace may be considered mentally mapped; the party can travel back through them at a cautious pace without risk of making a wrong turn. These benefits are reduced by extremely bad Luck or other special circumstances. 

**Normal Movement** is the assumed movement type in dangerous and unknown locales. Characters have the normal chances of bumbling into traps, ambushes, and similar troubles. Areas traveled through at this pace may also be considered mentally mapped.

**Running Movement** can only be done in nearly straight lines and relatively open areas without a chance of becoming lost. Only Luck checks can avoid activating every trap and ambush encountered. In dangerous locations, you are likely to trigger random encounter rolls *every round* of travel. Movement is stopped by doors, sharp turns, dead ends, combat, and other deleterious changes in the environment.

**Rushed Movement** is as fast as a character can go in areas that aren't relatively open and have twists, turns, and doors to navigate. It has the negative effects of Running Movement and is stopped by the same things. A character can attempt to run farther than the speed listed by successfully moving that distance, taking a point of STR, DEX, or STA damage, and succeeding in a DC 10 check of that attribute. This allows the character to continue another full increment of the speed. The character may repeat the damage and checks to each of the other two attributes until they are stopped or fail a check. Rushed movement is only available at the minute-by-minute time scale.

Example: Rob the Thief is fleeing a spectre that popped up between him and the way he came in. He's not in combat with it, so he can choose Rushed Movement. He runs for it down unknown paths. His Move is 30', and he's lucky enough to choose a long, lit hallway to flee down 90'. He wants to get farther, so he takes a point of DEX damage and succeeds in a DC 10 DEX check, making it another 90' to the end of the hallway and through an unlocked door to a darkened room. He has no light, so he can only make it into the room as far as the hallway's lights illuminate before the 'deleterious change' of not being able to see stops him.{.example}

## Movement in Minutes, Turns, and Hours in Safe Locations

**Relaxed Movement** is travel at a normal walking pace. This is normally hand-waved away, but is mentioned in case it becomes necessary to track time and distance in special circumstances, and is useful as a guideline. Any disturbing occurrance will immediately cause a relaxed adventurer to choose a slower form of movement more suited to the danger posed.

| Movement Type | Distance per Minute | Distance per Turn | Distance per Hour | Special |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -- | -- |
| Cautious | **(Move)** feet | **(Move x 10)** feet  |  **(Move x 60)** feet | never surprised by traps/ambushes |
| Normal | **(Move x 2)** feet | **(Move x 20)** feet| **(Move x 120)** feet | normal rules apply |
| Running     | **(Move x 20)** feet    | **(Move x 200)** feet     | **(Move / 5)** miles  |  used only in open areas in straight lines |
| Rushed | **(Move x 3)** feet (or faster) | **(Move x 150)** feet | **(Move / 2.5)** miles | dangerous, fatigueing, repeatable | 
| Relaxed     | **(Move x 10)** feet    | **(Move x 100)** feet     | **(Move / 10)** miles  |  used only in known safe areas |

Distance per hour shown above is given as a guideline; see @JournalEntry[Movement] for travel increments longer than a few turns.
