# Regarding Encumbrance

**For the most part, you can carry a reasonable amount. When important, though, here are the rules.**

Players need to have a reasonable explanation of how and where each item is being carried or worn, if asked.

Normal clothing, accessories, etc, are ignored.

Other items carry the following 'costs'.

| Example Items                                                         | Cost to Carry     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| 100 coins in a container                                              | +1 Item           |
| 10 arrows in a quiver                                                 | +1 Item           |
| something held in one hand                                            | +1 Item           |
| 100 loose coins                                                       | +1 Oversized Item |
| a large, filled sack                                                  | +1 Oversized Item |
| a carpet or similar tall item                                         | +1 Oversized Item |
| anything requiring two-hands to hold                                  | +1 Oversized Item |
| A slot of @Item[Fatigue]                                              | +1 Oversized Item |
| Any item a player has no good explanation for how it is being carried | +1 Oversized Item |

Determine how many Items and Oversized Items you have, then calculate encumbrance:

- Wearing heavy armor? **+1 Encumbrance**.
- 6 or more Items? **+1 Encumbrance**.
- 11 or more Items? **+1 Encumbrance**.
- 16 or more Items? **+1 Encumbrance**.
- 21 or more Items? **+1 Encumbrance**.
- Each Oversized Item: **+1 Encumbrance**.

Being Encumbered makes characters slower as shown below. In addition, total Encumbrance may be applied as a penalty to various activities or cause them to fail outright if narratively appropriate.

| Total | Level               | Effects   |
| ----- | ------------------- | --------- |
| 0-1   | Unencumbered        | Full Move |
| 2     | Lightly Encumbered  | ¾ Move    |
| 3     | Heavily Encumbered  | ½ Move,   |
| 4     | Severely Encumbered | ¼ Move    |
| 5+    | Over Encumbered     | No Move   |

Round Move to the nearest 5'.

These effects apply to pack animals and vehicles as well, though Encumbrance points may be reduced by expert packing, specific animal abilities, and so on.
