# Regarding Spellburn
Characters that can spellburn **must research, meditate, or otherwise discover the appropriate form their next spellburn must take**. This is reflected by a roll on the appropriate **Spellburn Actions** table. Any preparations or actions the result indicates must be performed before the spellburnt casting takes effect.

A character's next Spellburn Action should always be present as an inventory item on their sheet.

Casting a spell using spellburn calls for a new roll on the Spellburn Actions table.

After a night's rest, distant travel, or other major change in circumstances, a character may reroll on the Spellburn Actions table to replace an action that they wish to avoid. ("Bah, the King of Elfland desires golden buttons in addition to my flesh and strength! Let us wait and rest; perhaps tomorrow my changable patron will wish for something I actually have in this dank oubliette.")

**Some minor spellburn effects are not subject to the above rule**, as they aren't true spellburn. They are side effects of magic.

| Minor Magical Action | Cost |
|--|--|
| Cast a spell 'lost' for the day | 1 Strength |
| Attempt to 'activate' an unknown magical item or effect | 1 Agility |
| Attempt to intuit information about a magical creature | 1 Stamina |
