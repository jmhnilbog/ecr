<p><strong>Vine horrors</strong> are slow-moving corpses animated by the foul vines growing from seeds planted in their chests. The rotting bodies serve both as nutritious hosts for the vines and as seed pods, as mature vine horrors contain thousands of disgusting, @Actor[Awful Seeds] that can spread to other corpses or incapacitated creatures. They find successful purchase in humanoid corpses most often, but can germinate anywhere putrefaction offers sustenance.</p>
