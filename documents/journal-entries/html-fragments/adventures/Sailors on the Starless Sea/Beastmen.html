<p>The beastmen lurking within the keep are all villagers
corrupted by the lure of the chaos gods. The transformation
is both slow and torturous, inevitably driving
the subject mad with pain. And while the end result is
always horrific, each beastman is mutated in its own
unique fashion.corrupted by the lure of the chaos gods. The transformation
is both slow and torturous, inevitably driving
the subject mad with pain. And while the end result is

unique fashion.</p>
<p>While beastmen have the capacity to take orders, only
the champions and shamans retain the reasoning that
once distinguished them from the animal kingdom. In
the place of true intelligence, they develop animal cunning,
stalking their prey like a pack of wolves or a pride
of lions.</p>
<p>In general—insofar as such a term can be used—most
beastmen resemble their namesake: a hunched, feral
cross between a man and a beast.</p>
