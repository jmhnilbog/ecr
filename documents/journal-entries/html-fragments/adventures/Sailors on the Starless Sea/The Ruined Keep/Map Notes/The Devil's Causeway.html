<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>The two bodies here are @Token[Keary] and Alban, children of the village blacksmith. They have been changed into @Actor[Vine Horror]{Vine Horrors}, which spill thousands of horrid @Actor[Awful Seeds] when dispatched.</p>
<p>They have a pitiful amount of treasure on them.</p>

<p>An old <strong>dirt road</strong>, now <strong>overrun with weeds</strong> and sickly vines, rises
towards the ruined citadel. A grisly sight bars your way: <strong>a pair of bodies,
secured to poles</strong> by long ropey vines. The wicked <strong>vines have wormed their way
inside</strong> the bodiesâ€™ eyes, ears, and mouths.</p>

<p>Should they approach further, show the @JournalEntry[Bodies on the Causeway] handout, then...</p>
</div>
<div class="readaloud">
<p>To your horror, <em>you realize the
bodies are still moving</em>!</p>
</div>
<p>The vines unwind from the posts, freeing the
horrors to shamble toward the PCs.</p>
<p><strong>Any PC from the village that gets a good look at the corpses recognizes them as the village blacksmith's children, Keary and Alban.</strong> The brothers vanished from the village eleven days
ago. The beastmen killed the brothers and seeded their corpses
with vine horrors to ward off any investigations from the
townsfolk.</p>
<p>The bodies fall apart upon 'death', releasing piles of @Actor[Awful Seeds]. They hold a tiny amount of treasure as described in the summary above.</p>
