<p>The keep’s <strong>massive wall has collapsed here</strong>, spilling cyclopean stone blocks down the rocky slope. The blocks are <strong>precariously balanced</strong> atop one another, like a titan’s game of dice.</p>

<p>Several of the blocks are poised to shift if disturbed. Those
ascending the slope without noting the danger inevitably trigger a slide. One
false step and massive granite blocks tumble down the slope, crushing all in
their path...</p>

dying and the deafening crash of stone against stone.</p>
