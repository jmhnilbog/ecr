        <h1>Regarding Encumbrance</h1>
        <p><strong>For the most part, you can carry a reasonable amount. When important, though, here are the
                rules.</strong></p>
        <p>Players need to have a reasonable explanation of how and where each item is being carried or worn, if asked.
        </p>
        <p>Normal clothing, accessories, etc, are ignored.</p>
        <p>Other items carry the following 'costs'.</p>

        <p>Determine how many Items and Oversized Items you have, then calculate encumbrance:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wearing heavy armor? <strong>+1 Encumbrance</strong>.</li>
            <li>6 or more Items? <strong>+1 Encumbrance</strong>.</li>
            <li>11 or more Items? <strong>+1 Encumbrance</strong>.</li>
            <li>16 or more Items? <strong>+1 Encumbrance</strong>.</li>
            <li>21 or more Items? <strong>+1 Encumbrance</strong>.</li>
            <li>Each Oversized Item: <strong>+1 Encumbrance</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Being Encumbered makes characters slower as shown below. In addition, total Encumbrance may be applied as a
            penalty to various activities or cause them to fail outright if narratively appropriate.</p>

        <p>These effects apply to pack animals and vehicles as well, though Encumbrance points may be reduced by expert
            packing, specific animal abilities, and so on.</p>
