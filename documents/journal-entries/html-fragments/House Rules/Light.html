<p>Regarding Types of Light</p>
<dl>
<dt>Starlight</dt>
<dd>
<p>Starlight is not sunlight.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Sunlight</dt>
<dd>
<p>Sunlight is a specific kind of visible light, best known for emanating from the Sun.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Starlight is not a form of sunlight; nor is sunlight a form of starlight.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Ultra-violet radiation and other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum have nothing to do with sunlight. No effects specific to sunlight can be mimicked by playing footsie with UV lamps or other foolishness.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Reflected sunlight is still sunlight, though it becomes weaker as it reflects and diffuses. Polished reflective surfaces work best to redirect sunlight.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Unlight</dt>
<dd>
<p>Unlight is manufactured by truncating sunlight. It may counter sunlight.</p>
