<dt>Regarding Invisibility</dt>
<dd>
<p>Invisible creatures <em>usually</em> receive <strong>+2 to attacks and are difficult to locate.</strong> These bonuses are reduced or eliminated against creatures not visually-oriented.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Illusions or mental affects that mask the presence of an item or creature are <em><strong>not</strong></em> invisibility.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>Visible <strong>light travels through invisible creatures</strong> without affecting them in any way.</p>
</dd>
<dd>
<p>If the correct location of an invisible creature is targeted by an attack, it may be attacked normally, but <strong>a miss chance of up to 50% is applied</strong> on otherwise successful attacks.</p>
