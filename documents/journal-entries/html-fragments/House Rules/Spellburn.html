<h1>Regarding Spellburn</h1>
<p>Characters that can spellburn <strong>must research, meditate, or otherwise discover the appropriate form their next spellburn must take</strong>. This is reflected by a roll on the appropriate <strong>Spellburn Actions</strong> table. Any preparations or actions the result indicates must be performed before the spellburnt casting takes effect.</p>
<p>A character's next Spellburn Action should always be present as an inventory item on their sheet.</p>
<p>Casting a spell using spellburn calls for a new roll on the Spellburn Actions table.</p>
<p>After a night's rest, distant travel, or other major change in circumstances, a character may reroll on the Spellburn Actions table to replace an action that they wish to avoid. (&quot;Bah, the King of Elfland desires golden buttons in addition to my flesh and strength! Let us wait and rest; perhaps tomorrow my changable patron will wish for something I actually have in this dank oubliette.&quot;)</p>
<p><strong>Some minor spellburn effects are not subject to the above rule</strong>, as they aren't true spellburn. They are side effects of magic.</p>
