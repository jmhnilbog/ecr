<h2>Regarding Overland Movement</h2>
<ul>
<li>You can march (Move * 6 / 10) miles per day in good conditions. If on foot, add your Stamina modifier in miles.</li>
<li>You can travel an additional 50% of that distance with a forced march of 12 hours. Each day of forced march performed after the first inflicts [[/r 1d6]] damage on the characters, and also inflicts this damage on animals from the first day. An animal that suffers 5 or 6 points of damage in this manner dies at the end of a day’s journey.</li>
</ul>
