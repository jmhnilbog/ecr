# Regarding Luck
The character with the lowest Luck is usually the target of bad things.
<p>The character with the highest Luck is usually the target of good things.</p>
<p>A character that burns Luck without knowing how much is necessary for success may still do so. The minimum amount of Luck required for success is taken. If the roll would have succeeded anyway, 1 point of Luck is taken.</p>
<p>A character that reaches 0 Luck in this manner is killed in a very unlikely way.</p>
<p>A character may choose to Test Their Luck whenever they face a binary decision. This costs 1 Luck. The Judge makes a secret Luck check for the character and they make the most appropriate choice based on the success of the check.</p>
