{"name":"Tower of the Beast","content":"Flanked by crumbling stone walls,\nthe moss-covered tower stands proud despite the ravages of time. A\ntall, rust-bound portal bars the tower’s sole entrance, watched over\nby a leering demonic gargoyle. Rings of deep arrow slits pierce the\nthick walls, and overarching battlements loom high above.\nHeroes trying the tower door discover it barred from within.\nBreaking down the door requires a DC 20 Strength check. Alternately,\na PC armed with an axe or hammer can destroy the\ndoor with 5 minutes of hard labor.\nThe first PCs into the tower discover a hellish scene:\nThe hot stench of rot rolls from the tower, raising bile in the back of\nyour throat. The floor of the wide tower is covered in rotting hides of\ncattle, sheep and men. A narrow staircase spirals around the tower\nwall. Dark forms hang from chains spiked through the wall—surely\nthese are your fellow countrymen!\nA pack of snarling beast-men slowly emerges from the shadows,\nbloody spears clutched in their gnarled hands!\nThe beastmen lurk within the tower, trying to lure the PCs inside\none at a time. An enormous beastman champion—a seven-\nfoot monstrosity with the head of a feral bull— crouches\natop the spiral staircase directly above the door, attacking the\nPCs with surprise from above.\nThe beastmen fight so long as the champion lives, then do\ntheir best to flee the tower into the courtyard. They refuse to\nsurrender but take captives if they are able. Captured PCs are\nbound in chains and hung upside-down from the arrow slits\nlike their fellow villagers, before being subjected to the soulwarping\nenergies of the Well of Souls, transforming the erstwhile\nheroes into feral beastmen.\nThe beastman champion wears a large silver torc hung with\nbleached skulls. Each skull is branded with a chaos rune. By\nvirtue of the craftsmanship and precious metal, the torc is\nworth 100 gp, but when donned by a chaotic or evil wizard, the\ntorc grants a +1 bonus to all spell checks. Destroying the torc\ngrants lawful aligned PCs a bonus of +1 XP, while earning them\nthe notice (and perhaps enmity) of the gods of Chaos.\n\nThe tower floor and the steps spiraling up the wall are covered\nin gore-covered furs. Searching the chamber scatters waves of\nfleas and lice. Worse, there is a 1 in 6 chance that the searcher\nencounters a rot grub hidden amid the rotting hides. On a successful\nattack, the grub burrows into the PC’s flesh, working\nits way toward the heart in 1d4+2 rounds. Digging out the\ngrub requires a DC 15 Agility check, causing 1 hp of damage\nper attempt. Barbers, surgeons, and other PCs with a medical\nbackground receive a +2 bonus to the check. If the grub isn’t\nremoved in time, it burrows into the victim’s heart, resulting\nin instantaneous death.\n\nPersistent searchers discover a small alcove set in the floor,\nhidden by piles of rotting hides. The alcove contains loose\ncoins (53 sp, 23 gp, and 2 pp) and an elven short sword set\nwith emeralds (worth 150 gp) wrapped in a simple green\ncloak. Sewn into the hem of the cloak is a treasure map inked\non vellum and leading to the location of the judge’s choosing.\nThree torches, still flammable despite their age, are set in\nsconces on the wall.\nFinally, if an unlucky player has lost all his PCs in the course\nof the adventure, the judge can opt to allow the PCs to rescue\nvillagers from their chains on the walls. Nursed back to\nconsciousness, the unfortunate souls offer to join the party, becoming\nPCs under the players’ control. Regrettably (though\nperhaps mercifully), freed villagers can recall nothing of their\nordeal after their capture. The player should roll up the 0-level\nPCs per the standard rules. At the judge’s discretion, up to six\nPCs can be added to the party from the captives hanging in\nthe tower.\nIf none of the players need replacement PCs, the freed captives\nare too weak and terrified to do anything other than flee back\nto their village. Regardless of how many captives are freed,\nthey are but a third of the total villagers kidnapped from the\ncharacters’ home."}

{"name":"Sailors On The Starless Sea: Overview","content":"# Sailors on the Starless Sea\n\n## Introduction\n\n***This adventure is designed for 10 to 15 0-level characters, or a much smaller\nparty of 1st and 2nd level characters aided by hirelings. In playtest groups of\n15 0-level PCs, 7 or 8 typically survive.***\n\n*Bent on stopping the rash of abductions plaguing their village, the characters\ndiscover a horde of vile beastmen inhabiting the ancient keep on the hill.\nSeeking the source of these abominations, the PCs uncover an ancient chaos cult\nand its source: an antediluvian ziggurat set in the center of a vast, \nunderground sea. There, at the font of chaos, the PCs witness a wicked rite\nculminating in the sacrifice of their fellow villagers. If the PCs can interrupt\nthe rite before its conclusion and stave off the rebirth of the legendary chaos\nlord, they stand a chance of escaping the underworld alive. But if their courage\nor luck should fail them, the PCs will suffer a fate more fearsome than death, \ntheir spirits fueling the infernal might of the reborn chaos lord.*\n\n## Background   \n \n::: dm-only\nAges past, innumerable chaos cults flourished on the edge of civilization. For\neach holy spire rising to extol the virtues of goodness and law, there was an \ninfernal reflection, offering mankind material power and wealth in exchange for\ncruel acts and bloody sacrifice. Humanity was a young and foolish race, and many\na prince and peon sold his soul in exchange for power over his foeman. But as\ncivilization endured, uniting tribes into clans and clans into kingdoms, slowly\nthe light of law beat back the chaos.\n\nNot to be outdone, the powers of chaos and evil sought out champions of profound\nwickedness and cruelty, mortals possessed of the strength of will to lead the \nhordes of chaos against the armies of the enemy.\n\nThese champions were the chaos lords.\n\nThe brothers **Molan** and **Felan** were two such champions. Vicious and cunning beyond\nmeasure, and without a scrap of mercy in their war-hardened hearts, they led\nhordes of bestial humanoids to victory against the armies of good. With the\nspoils of their bloody campaigns, they raised a mighty keep and rained terror\nand violence down upon all in their demesne.\n\nIn the end, the brothers’ success was their undoing. Disparate forces of men, \ndwarves, and elves rallied together in a crusade against the wicked chaos lords.\nFor thirty-nine days, the allies laid siege to the foul keep. And on the\nfortieth day, the captain of the elves dealt Felan a mortal blow. **Realizing that\nhis own end was drawing near, Molan retreated into the ancient caves beneath the\nkeep. First the chaos lord entombed his brother in a hidden crypt, defended by\nno less than four curses. Then, as the armies of good laid waste to the keep, \nMolan gave up his mortal shell, commending his damned soul into the writhing\nlimbs of the gods of Chaos.**\n\n**Molan made only one request. When ages had passed, and the armies of good fell\ninto disarray once more, he asked to return and lay waste to his ancient foes.**\n\n***That time has come.***\n:::\n\nTo start: @JournalEntry[1lLWFIexmc9Wn6NT]"}
{"name":"Charnel Ruins","content":"This once-proud edifice has fallen\ninto ruin like the rest of the keep. All that remains of the building are\nfire-scarred high stone walls and toad-faced gargoyles leering from\nabove. The singed, bronze doors—cast with hundreds of wailing demonic\nfaces—are barred from the outside. The portal is marked with\na single word drawn in flaking red paint: REPENT.\nWhen the keep fell to the forces of good, acolytes of the chaos\ngod sought refuge within their chapel. Fearing to tread on unholy\nground, the invaders barred the doors from without and\nset fire to the temple, burning the wicked acolytes alive.\nIt is a simple matter to open the portals. Heroes removing the\ngreat wooden beam can easily draw open the bronze portals\nby the enormous rings held within the maws of two fiendish\ndemons.\nInside, the PCs discover a horrific scene:\nSix charred skeletons lie about the chapel, some crushed by burnt\nfallen beams. At the head of the chapel is a fountain depicting a squat,\ndemonic toad. A foul, black ichor seeps from the toad’s broad lips,\npooling in the basin seated at the foot of the fountain.\nEven though the slaughter took place decades ago, the stench\nof charred flesh lingers in the air along with the sour scent of\nfreshly burnt incense.\nBrave PCs that dare to test the skeletons find that the charred\nbones are hot to the touch, as if the fire burned only yesterday.\nCinders glow red and orange beneath each fallen bone.\nA cursory inspection of the frog fountain reveals red gemstone\neyes and jeweled fangs within the loathsome maw. All together,\nthe 12 semi-precious stones are worth 150 gp.\nThe following items lie scattered about the temple and skeletons:\n• A golden censer, hanging at the end of a long bronze\nchain, blackened from the heat. The censer is worth 65 gp\nand can be used to placate certain agents of Chaos (see\nbelow).\n• A blackened iron coffer, half-buried in the rubble. The coffer\nis locked and must be picked (DC 15 pick locks) or\nsmashed open (DC 12 Str). Inside are three cones of incense\nwrapped in sanctified, unholy cloth stitched with\ngolden signs of Chaos.\n• Three scorched chainmail hauberks.\n• Three blackened maces and one flail.\nRetrieving any of the gear or the gems requires entering the\nchapel. Those stepping inside the temple immediately hear the\ncrackling of cinders and feel the heat of the blackened earth\nbeneath their feet. Though unsettling, this poses no threat to\nthe heroes. Similarly, the charred skeletons offer no danger.\nThe same cannot be said, however, of the black ichor dribbling\nfrom the fountain’s maw and collecting in the fetid basin. Heroes\ncoming within 10 feet of the basin can feel the heat coming\noff of the toad-fountain. As the PCs come within 5 feet, the\nooze animates and rolls up and out of the basin, attacking the\nnearest PC.\nOn the round following a successful pseudopod attack, the tar\nooze ignites, inflicting 1d4 points of fire damage and setting\nfire to the unlucky PC. Putting out the fire requires 1 action\nand quickness on the part of the hero. (“Stop, drop and roll!”\nis sufficient, but PCs whose players are unable to succinctly\ndescribe how they put out the flaming tar burn for another\nround.)\nThe tar ooze can also be placated by swinging the charred\ncenser, filling the fallen chapel with incense smoke. So long as\nthe area is suffused with smoke, the tar ooze sits motionless,\nunmoving and still. There is sufficient incense in the censer to\nkeep the ooze still for 5 rounds. The 3 cones sealed in the coffer\ncan also burn for up to 5 rounds each.\nThe censer can also be used to placate the chaos leviathan lurking\nbeneath the waves in area 1-4."}

{"name":"Exploration","content":"::: house-rules\n# Regarding Exploration\n\n## Searching\nIt only takes a character a minute to perform a cursory search of a 20x20 room, revealing obvious things and potentially triggering traps. The character can roll any automatic chances to detect secret doors or similar.\nIt takes 30 minutes to really look at the same area. The character has normal Find/Detect Traps chances, and so on.\nIt takes a character an hour to make a complete search of a 20x20 room, revealing everything possible about the area, noticing and avoiding any traps, and discovering any secret doors and operating mechanisms present.\nCharacters can work together to search the same area faster or a larger area in the same time.\n\n## Maps\nMaps are useful when accurate and horrible when not so. Parties following an accurate map of an indoor or small-scale map will not make wrong turns if travelling with **Cautious** or **Normal Movement**, and they keep an accurate mental map of travel at those paces. A skilled cartographer may create or keep a paper map updated when moving at those paces.\nMental maps are only useful for ground covered in the previous few days before becoming inaccurate. Inexpertly made paper maps require a skill check whenever they are added to in order to avoid inaccuracy.\n\nLuck checks are required when following inaccurate maps. Any decision point or obvious error requires a check. Failure causes the party to make a wrong turn, success allows a correct turn (or the best possible turn if wrong turns have lead the party astray already) and notifies the party of the map's inaccuracy when the next check would be required.\n\n## Movement While Exploring Dangerous Locales\n\nCharacters' movement within combat is defined by their Move scores and Encumbrance. Outside of combat--exploring their world or fleeing haphazardly from the foes that dwell in it--they move at different speeds. Players are free to choose any of these types of movement when out of combat. You are likely to be asked to calculate Encumbrance before choosing Rushed Movement, and should start dropping heavy things!\n\n**Cautious Movement** is slow and steady. When moving cautiously, characters will not activate traps simply by passing through an area. The party will discover evidence of any such trap before it can trigger. Any chance to detect the presence of secret doors when searching will trigger automatically, and they will not be surprised by any ambush they encounter. Areas the party has traveled through at this pace may be considered mentally mapped; the party can travel back through them at a cautious pace without risk of making a wrong turn. These benefits are reduced by extremely bad Luck or other special circumstances. \n\n**Normal Movement** is the assumed movement type in dangerous and unknown locales. Characters have the normal chances of bumbling into traps, ambushes, and similar troubles. Areas traveled through at this pace may also be considered mentally mapped.\n\n**Running Movement** can only be done in nearly straight lines and relatively open areas without a chance of becoming lost. Only Luck checks can avoid activating every trap and ambush encountered. In dangerous locations, you are likely to trigger random encounter rolls *every round* of travel. Movement is stopped by doors, sharp turns, dead ends, combat, and other deleterious changes in the environment.\n\n**Rushed Movement** is as fast as a character can go in areas that aren't relatively open and have twists, turns, and doors to navigate. It has the negative effects of Running Movement and is stopped by the same things. A character can attempt to run farther than the speed listed by successfully moving that distance, taking a point of STR, DEX, or STA damage, and succeeding in a DC 10 check of that attribute. This allows the character to continue another full increment of the speed. The character may repeat the damage and checks to each of the other two attributes until they are stopped or fail a check. Rushed movement is only available at the minute-by-minute time scale.\n\nExample: Rob the Thief is fleeing a spectre that popped up between him and the way he came in. He's not in combat with it, so he can choose Rushed Movement. He runs for it down unknown paths. His Move is 30', and he's lucky enough to choose a long, lit hallway to flee down 90'. He wants to get farther, so he takes a point of DEX damage and succeeds in a DC 10 DEX check, making it another 90' to the end of the hallway and through an unlocked door to a darkened room. He has no light, so he can only make it into the room as far as the hallway's lights illuminate before the 'deleterious change' of not being able to see stops him.{.example}\n\n## Movement in Minutes, Turns, and Hours in Safe Locations\n\n**Relaxed Movement** is travel at a normal walking pace. This is normally hand-waved away, but is mentioned in case it becomes necessary to track time and distance in special circumstances, and is useful as a guideline. Any disturbing occurrance will immediately cause a relaxed adventurer to choose a slower form of movement more suited to the danger posed.\n\n| Movement Type | Distance per Minute | Distance per Turn | Distance per Hour | Special |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- | -- | -- |\n| Cautious | **(Move)** feet | **(Move x 10)** feet  |  **(Move x 60)** feet | never surprised by traps/ambushes |\n| Normal | **(Move x 2)** feet | **(Move x 20)** feet| **(Move x 120)** feet | normal rules apply |\n| Running     | **(Move x 20)** feet    | **(Move x 200)** feet     | **(Move / 5)** miles  |  used only in open areas in straight lines |\n| Rushed | **(Move x 3)** feet (or faster) | **(Move x 150)** feet | **(Move / 2.5)** miles | dangerous, fatigueing, repeatable | \n| Relaxed     | **(Move x 10)** feet    | **(Move x 100)** feet     | **(Move / 10)** miles  |  used only in known safe areas |\n\nDistance per hour shown above is given as a guideline; see @JournalEntry[Movement] for travel increments longer than a few turns.\n\n### Example Speeds\n\n#### Move 30'{.table-header}\n\n| Movement Type | Distance per Minute | Distance per Turn | Distance per Hour |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- | -- | \n| Cautious | 30' | 300'  | 1800' (~⅓ mile) | \n| Normal | 60' | 600' | 3600' (~⅔ mile) | \n| Running      | 600' | 6000'  (~1.1 miles)   | 6 miles  | \n| Rushed | 90', 180', 270', or 360' | X | X | \n| Relaxed     | 300'    | 3000' (~.6 miles)    | 3 miles  |  \n\n#### Move 25'{.table-header}\n\n| Movement Type | Distance per Minute | Distance per Turn | Distance per Hour |\n| -------- | -------- | -------- | -- | \n| Cautious | 25' | 250'  | 1500' (~.3 mile) | \n| Normal | 50' | 500' | 3000' (~.6 mile) | \n| Running      | 500' | 5000'  (~1 mile)   | 5 miles  | \n| Rushed | 75', 150', 225', or 300' | X | X | \n| Relaxed     | 250'    | 2500' (~.5 miles)    | 2.5 miles  |  \n\n:::"}
