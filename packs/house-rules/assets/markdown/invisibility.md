  Invisibility
  : **Invisible creatures receive +2 to attacks and are difficult to locate for sight-oriented creatures**, such as most player characters. 
  
    If the correct location of an invisible creature is targeted by an attack, it may be attacked normally, but a miss chance of up to 50% is applied even if that attack would otherwise hit.
    
    | Miss Chance | Example Circumstances |
    |--|--|
    | 0% | An explosion larger that the guessed location; a successful **Mighty Deed** |
    | 10% | The attack of a giant naked mole rat; a powerful blind swordsman's attack |
    | 25% | A cloud of flour gives away the outline of the invisible creature; the attack of a blind ooze |
    | 50% | Normal attacks without mitigating circumstances |
