Sunlight
: Sunlight is a specific kind of visible light, best known for emanating from the Sun. Starlight is not a form of sunlight. Ultra-violet radiation and other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum have nothing to do with it. Any effects specific to sunlight can't be mimicked by playing footsie with UV lamps.
: Reflected sunlight is still sunlight, though it becomes weaker as it reflects and diffuses. Polished reflective surfaces work best to redirect sunlight.

Unlight
: Unlight is manufactured by truncating sunlight. It may counter sunlight.
