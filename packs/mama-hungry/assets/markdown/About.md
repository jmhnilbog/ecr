# About Mama Hungry

She's the bad ogre who steals your kids. She's the medieval Candyman. She's Baba
Yaga in a hut made out of candy, walking around on a hundred Oompa-Loompa legs.
She's a magical hag. She lives in the deep forest, all the deep forests. She's
hangry as fuck and Snickers won't be invented for like a thousand years.

While she has a high degree of control over her own physical appearance, she has
two main forms. When happy, she's a nine-foot-tall, gluttonous, slobbering,
flabby matron with a high-pitched voice. When angry, she's a twelve-foot-tall,
near-skeletal monster with an enormous belly and sagging folds of skin, howling
and raging and desperate to eat. No matter what, she smells like stew and
cinnamon, and is always scratching at the thousands of little flea-like
parasites that pester her.

## Happy Mama Hungry

Happy Mama Hungry does her best to not eat people, at least not people she
likes. She likes to keep a few children around because they are just so cute
though, and good children are so good at helping around the house and the
experiments and flea-baths and couldn't you just eat them up nom nom nom oops
she didn't mean to eat Hansel but he was just too cute! Things that make her
happy:

- delicious food, cooking
- babies, children, grandparents
- cooking babies and children
- revenge (on her enemies or yours)
- new magic
- flea baths
- invocation of her name by angry parents, anywhere

## Angry Mama Hungry

Angry Mama Hungry is something to flee first and try to placate later.

She retreats at half hp of whatever form she is in. Calming, blessing,
banishment, and protection spells do 1d6 damage to her per 'level' of success in
this form.

If forced to flee, she will bear a grudge.
