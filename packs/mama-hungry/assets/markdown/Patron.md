### Prey Form

Casting time: 1 action
Duration: usually 10 minutes/caster level

With a bang and flash of smoke, the caster is transformed into a prey animal of a well-known type native to the region. While in animal form the caster retains their mental faculties and has access to all of the natural abilities of the animal in question. Usually, this renders them unable to cast spells due to the inability to speak or accomplish the required sigil gestures in this new form. While the caster’s level limits the size of the form they can assume, the nature of the spell also limits its effects to naturally occurring creatures.

When cast in immediate danger and used to flee it, add +4 to this spell check.

When transforming into a mouse for example, the caster can only transform to a natural 1 HP rodent, regardless of their caster level.

When reduced to 0 HP while transformed the caster reverts to their original shape. Wounds transfer. If the animal form had fewer HP than the caster's natural form, roll a DC 10 Fort save. On success, the caster heals 1d6 * (caster level) HP. Failure, the caster suffers 1d3 HP.

The caster may always choose result 12 on a higher result.

Corruption: Roll 1d6: (1) minor; (2) one of the caster’s limbs is permanently transformed into the limb of ananimal; (3) the caster’s body is permanently covered in scales, fur or feathers; (4) the caster’s face and headtakes on major bestial characteristics permanently; (5) major; (6) greater.

Misfire: Roll 1d4: (1) instead of the body, the caster’s mind is affected: for 2d5 rounds they are entirely underthe delusion that they are the animal they were trying to transform into; (2) determine a successful result byrolling 1d20+13, apply the effect to the nearest creature to the caster; (3) an appropriate animal appears out ofthin air (in the case of tiny or small creatures a swarm may manifest) and attacks the caster; (4) determine a successful result by rolling 1d20+11, the effect on the caster is permanent.

1: Lost, failure, worse.
2: Lost, failure.
8: Failure.
10: A nearby animal of the type requested is compelled to arrive within 30' of the caster. It is otherwise nonmagical.
12: The caster manages to grasp the animal form they desire but only partially. They may choose onefeature of any mundane animal: gills, claws, or fur for example. This feature is transplanted upon their natural form and grants an appropriate benefit for the duration of the spell: gills allow the character to breathe underwater, claws provide a 1d6 unarmed attack, fur provides protection from the cold and a +1 AC boost, and so on. The effect lasts a number of turns equal to caster level or until the caster chooses to end it. The caster may replace any higher result with this one.

Note that the nature of the transformation replaces existing body parts with functioning and proportionally sized bestial ones. It does not create additional limbs. Should the caster ask for wings, their arms are transformed into wings and if they ask for gills, their lungs are replaced by a functioning set of gills.

14: The spell transforms the caster into any mundane prey animal of HD up to caster level and 1/16th the caster's body mass. They retain their faculties, and gain any abilities of the animal in question, including senses and modes of locomotion. Modes of locomotion not native to the caster (like flight) require 1d3 turns of adaptation before they may be safely used. The effect lasts a number of turns equal to caster level or until the caster chooses to end it.

16: As 14, but the animal may have up to 1/8th the caster's body mass.

18: As 14, but the animal may have up to 1/4 the caster's body mass.

20: As 14, but the animal may have up to 1/2 the caster's body mass.

24: As 14, but tha animal may have up to the caster's body mass. Adaptation to novel modes of locomotion takes only 1 turn of adaptation or a DC 10 Luck Check or a DC 15 Fort Save.

26: As 24, but the caster may double the duration--or transform another creature instead at half the spell result.

28: As 26, but the prey animal may have up to 2x the caster's body mass.

30: As 26, but the prey animal may be a magical beast OR up to 4x the caster's body mass.

32+: As 30, but you may transform up to (caster level) x 2 willing participants within 20' as well as yourself.

### Predator Form

### Prey

Drawing upon the natural laws of hunter and hunted, this spell summons or creates a single animal of a type commonly preyed upon by the local fauna, chosen by the caster.

1: Lost, failure, worse.
2: Lost, failure.
10: The animal is compelled to arrive within 100' but is otherwise non-magical.
12: The animal arrives within 30', but is otherwise non-magical.
14: The animal arrives within 30' and is compelled to rest and wait for one minute. At the end of the minute, the animal likely flees.
16: As 14, but the animal speaks your language and will answer questions put to it. The ability to speak leaves when the spell ceases.
18: As 16, but the spell does not cease if at the end of the spell duration, the caster whispers the spell once more before immediately starting a hunt for the creature. This effectively gives the animal a round to flee before the hunt is on. If the hunt fails, give a luck check
Should the caster successfully hunt and catch the creature before attempting to cast another spell, they gain two of the following benefits, chosen at random. The caster does NOT automatically know the benefits.

# If Killed
