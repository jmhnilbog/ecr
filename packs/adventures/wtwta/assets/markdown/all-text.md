# Where the White Things Are

## Overview

Labor disputes, boredom, commerce, and piracy in a liminal space-time.

The adventurers may discover that everyone they know and they themselves are employees of Discontinuous Distribution.

## Hooks

### Ssssurragh, guardian demon

He's a 30' long coral snake with a one-eyed, one-horned reptilian humanoid head and a badge-like blue jewel under his cleft chin.

Guardian demons do not normally interact with the dimension the adventurers perceive as time. Ssssurragh's binding by agents of Discontinuous Distribution has exposed him to infinite expressions of infinite duration and bottomless reservoirs of boredom.

He is generally friendly, even surprisingly so, though he's a close talker. His head is nearly four feet tall and topped with a two-foot horn, which can be unsettling all up in your face.

#### Sowing Suspicion

Sssssurragh will bring up his name at the beginning of conversations, refer to himself in the third person, and mention his name whenever he can. He 

His binding requires him to:

* Protect Discontinuous Distribution employees.
* Protect the facility.
* Protect the inventory.
* Obey the intent of direct orders from Discontinuous Distribution employees of rank Cardinal or higher as related to the other directives.

Where these come into conflict, the first-listed directive takes precedent.

The death or banishment of Ssssurragh breaks the binding, as it would any guardian demon. The only 

Motivations:

* Suicide by adventurer. More than anything, he wants to be killed. This looks like the best option for him, since he thinks this will void the contract holding him in guardianship and allow him to reform elsewhere. Even if he can't reform, he'd rather not be than keep working here.

* Escape. If persuaded that 

Ssssurragh wants to be killed by the adventurers so he can be done with this fucking job. His demonic binding has put many bans on his allowed behavior, so he can't work directly towards this goal. His "Boss" is usually watching him, and will intervene if he gets too obviously suicidal. Sucks to be Sssssurragh.

### Cardinal Bezzoars, hypervisor

The Boss. Usually yelling at Sssssurragh from a drone's screen.

The drones are non-specialized constructs that can take one of two forms.

## Complications

The adventurers are a polluted prism brought into the logistics network. Their experiences are the pseudo-light refracted through it. That prism refracts differently as the adventures themselves do.
