- The keepâ€™s **walls rise 30 feet from their rammed earth embankments**. The walls and all the fallen stones are covered in a patchwork of moss, sickly vines, and lichen. Climbing them requires a **DC 15 climb check to avoid falling 20' for [[/r 2d6]] damage** before tumbling down to the base of the rammed earth mound. Remember that falls also include a **chance of broken bones**; each ***6*** rolled adds a broken bone and permanent loss of ***1 Strength or Agility*** as described in @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-text.Chapter 4: Combat].
- The walls and all the fallen stones are **covered in a patchwork of moss, sickly vines, and lichen**.
- Rather than simple carved blocks, the keep seems to have been **built of enormous standing stones and mighty dolmens**. The blocks are fitted together crudely, leaving **cracks between the stones** for rotting vegetation and pools of water that act as host to the **gnats and mosquitoes**.

During the Day
: The keep betrays no obvious signs of patrols or movement in and out.
: Roll [[/r 1d6]] for a random encounter every hour. On a *1*, roll a result from @Compendium[ecr.sotss-rolltables.The Ruined Keep: Random Encounters].

At Dusk
: Two @Compendium[ecr.sotss-creatures.Beastman]{Beastmen} (from above the @Compendium[ecr.sotss-journals.The Gatehouse]) light torches on the ruined battlements.
: The glow of the @Compendium[ecr.sotss-journals.The Sinkhole] becomes more obvious.
: Roll [[/r 1d6]] for a random encounter every hour. On a *1*, roll a result from @Compendium[ecr.sotss-rolltables.The Ruined Keep: Random Encounters].
: Remember that light sources will be easily seen by the beastmen.

At Night
: Torches and the @Compendium[ecr.sotss-journals.The Sinkhole]  throw weird shadows. 
: Glimpses of the beastmen above the @Compendium[ecr.sotss-journals.The Gatehouse] may be seen if closely watched. 
: The beastmen within the @Compendium[ecr.sotss-journals.The Tower of the Beast] patrol the Keep instead of waiting in place. They hide in the darkness as best they can to attack intruders in the courtyard.
: Roll [[/r 1d6]] for a random encounter every hour. On a *1*, roll a result from @Compendium[ecr.sotss-rolltables.The Ruined Keep: Random Encounters]. Any beastmen encountered will be rushing to join the ritual.
: Remember that light sources will be easily seen by the beastmen.

Two Hours before Dawn
: All the @Compendium[ecr.sotss-creatures.Beastman]{Beastmen} descend below to join the ritual, which will succeed before dawn unless the PCs do something about it.
: Roll [[/r 1d6]] for a random encounter every hour. On a *1*, roll a result from @Compendium[ecr.sotss-rolltables.The Ruined Keep: Random Encounters]. Replace any beastman encounters with a terrible feeling of dread: any PCs that fail a **DC 5 Will** check flee and are removed from play. They really should have been more proactive.

## Approaching the Ruins

The PCs are free to enter as they see fit.

| Approach | Details |
|--|--
| Up the road, from the south | This, the most obvious approach, takes them up the causeway (@Compendium[ecr.sotss-journals.The Causeway]). This is also the most dangerous. Wily characters will be rewarded for their suspicion, though hesitation should never be mistaken for caution. |
| Through the crumbled wall, from the west | Part of the wall has crumbled, and entering this way requires the characters to ascend @Compendium[ecr.sotss-journals.The Ruined Wall]. Picking their way through the fallen blocks is not difficult, but carries its own risks as noted below. |
| Across the sinkhole, from the northeast | A lot of chutzpa and a lot of rope are needed to get past @Compendium[ecr.sotss-journals.The Sinkhole] |
| Climbing the walls elsewhere | See *features* above for details. |

The following text assumes the PCs arrive at the keep during daylight.

::: readaloud

You stand before the ruined keep, which squats atop a **low, craggy hill**, its walls of toppled stone and massive granite blocks hinting at forgotten battles and the clash of mighty armies. Now the ruins seem host only to creeping vines and the foul miasma that drifts down from the keep.

The **air is overrun with pestilence**. Fat flies bite at you incessantly, and **clouds of small black insects** choke your every breath. The long-abandoned land is **choked with thorny vines** that drape the **sickly trees** and hang from the **ruined walls**. There is an **odor of rot and decay**, as if the hill itself were decomposing from within.

A sight gives you pause: **a ragged banner, depicting a crimson skull on a black field**, stands high atop the ruined walls. Whatever lurks within has terrorized you and your village for far too long.

You turn to your companions and ready your meager weapons. The time for retribution has come.
