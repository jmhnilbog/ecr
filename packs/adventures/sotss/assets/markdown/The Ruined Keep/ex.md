# Introduction
The following is an attempt to better familiarize myself with CSS typography and maybe learn a bit about vertical rythmn.

The technique used here is inspired by the [Richard Rutter article](href="http://24ways.org/2006/compose-to-a-vertical-rhythm/") from 24 Ways, and leverages SASS to do the math.

Feel free to turn the guides off and on by setting the $enable-guide variable to _null_ or _non-null_, respectively.

See? E'ery t'ing lines up all nice and proper.

## No lorem ipsum?
Yeah, I decided against using _"lorem ipsum,"_ at least here, so that I could arrange my thoughts as part time of the exercise. It is my understanding that the art of typography deals with the elegant and useful arrangement of thought.

# Excuses, excuses
I can't quite remember why I put in this heading, honestly, but Im keeping it as a momento.

I've got to wonder whether this blockquote is diaturbing things a bit. The lines are not _'on beat,'_ but the math does return use to a proper rythmn. Check the guides, if you dont believe me. Im not realky sure if this is kosher though.

## Why, praytell, Jade?
I'm learning it, so I'm using it. I should probably use Markdown instead for this particular application.
