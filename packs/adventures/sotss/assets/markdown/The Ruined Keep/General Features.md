The keepâ€™s **walls rise 30'** from their
rammed earth embankments. The walls and all the fallen
stones are covered in a patchwork of moss, sickly vines, and lichen. Climbing them requires a **DC 15 climb check to avoid falling 20' for [[/r 2d6]] damage** before tumbling
down to the base of the rammed earth mound. Remember that each *6* rolled for fall damage indicates a broken bone.

Rather than simple carved blocks, the keep seems to
have been built of enormous standing stones and mighty dolmens.
The blocks are **fitted together crudely**, leaving cracks between
the stones for rotting vegetation and **pools of water** that
act as host to the **gnats and mosquitoes**.

## Vision

**At night**, the keep is usually lit only by a few torches and whatever illumination the moon and stars deign to give. Tonight, due to the ritual taking place underneath the keep, a dim aurora adds some visibility. 

## Random Encounters

Roll [[/r 1d6]] every hour the characters are in or near the keep, and when something particularly 'loud' happens. On a *1*, a random encounter occurrs.
