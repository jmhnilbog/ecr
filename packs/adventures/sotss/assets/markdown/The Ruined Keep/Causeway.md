An old **dirt road**, now **overrun with weeds** and sickly vines, rises
towards the ruined citadel. A grisly sight bars your way: **a pair of bodies, 
secured to poles** by long ropey vines. The wicked **vines have wormed their way
inside** the bodiesâ€™ eyes, ears, and mouths.   
:::

## Upon Closer Look...

::: readaloud
To your horror, *you realize the
bodies are still moving*.
:::

 The vines unwind from the posts, freeing the
horrors to shamble toward the PCs. 

**Any PC from the village that gets a good look at the corpses recognizes them as the village blacksmith's children, Keary and Alban.** The brothers vanished from the village eleven days
ago. The beastmen killed the brothers and seeded their corpses
with vine horrors to ward off any investigations from the
townsfolk.
