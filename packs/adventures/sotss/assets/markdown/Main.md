# Sailors on the Starless Sea

## Introduction

***This adventure is designed for 10 to 15 0-level characters, or a much smaller
party of 1st and 2nd level characters aided by hirelings. In playtest groups of
15 0-level PCs, 7 or 8 typically survive.***

*Bent on stopping the rash of abductions plaguing their village, the characters
discover a horde of vile beastmen inhabiting the ancient keep on the hill.
Seeking the source of these abominations, the PCs uncover an ancient chaos cult
and its source: an antediluvian ziggurat set in the center of a vast, 
underground sea. There, at the font of chaos, the PCs witness a wicked rite
culminating in the sacrifice of their fellow villagers. If the PCs can interrupt
the rite before its conclusion and stave off the rebirth of the legendary chaos
lord, they stand a chance of escaping the underworld alive. But if their courage
or luck should fail them, the PCs will suffer a fate more fearsome than death, 
their spirits fueling the infernal might of the reborn chaos lord.*

## Background   
 
::: dm-only
Ages past, innumerable chaos cults flourished on the edge of civilization. For
each holy spire rising to extol the virtues of goodness and law, there was an 
infernal reflection, offering mankind material power and wealth in exchange for
cruel acts and bloody sacrifice. Humanity was a young and foolish race, and many
a prince and peon sold his soul in exchange for power over his foeman. But as
civilization endured, uniting tribes into clans and clans into kingdoms, slowly
the light of law beat back the chaos.

Not to be outdone, the powers of chaos and evil sought out champions of profound
wickedness and cruelty, mortals possessed of the strength of will to lead the 
hordes of chaos against the armies of the enemy.

These champions were the chaos lords.

The brothers **Molan** and **Felan** were two such champions. Vicious and cunning beyond
measure, and without a scrap of mercy in their war-hardened hearts, they led
hordes of bestial humanoids to victory against the armies of good. With the
spoils of their bloody campaigns, they raised a mighty keep and rained terror
and violence down upon all in their demesne.

In the end, the brothers’ success was their undoing. Disparate forces of men, 
dwarves, and elves rallied together in a crusade against the wicked chaos lords.
For thirty-nine days, the allies laid siege to the foul keep. And on the
fortieth day, the captain of the elves dealt Felan a mortal blow. **Realizing that
his own end was drawing near, Molan retreated into the ancient caves beneath the
keep. First the chaos lord entombed his brother in a hidden crypt, defended by
no less than four curses. Then, as the armies of good laid waste to the keep, 
Molan gave up his mortal shell, commending his damned soul into the writhing
limbs of the gods of Chaos.**

**Molan made only one request. When ages had passed, and the armies of good fell
into disarray once more, he asked to return and lay waste to his ancient foes.**

***That time has come.***

## Rumors & Superstitions

The keep looming high on the hill has long been a source of fearsome tales and
terrible legends. The locals are steeped in superstitious lore surrounding the
keep; some of the tales ring with truth while others are misleading wives’ tales
or the fanciful mumblings of a town drunk.

It is up to the players to sort the truth from the lies, for while the rumors
offer valuable clues, they can also lure foolish characters to their doom.

**Before beginning the adventure, give each player a rumor from:** @Compendium[ecr.sotss-rolltables.Rumors & Superstitions]

## Player Start

:::: readaloud 
You stand before the ruined keep, which squats atop a low, craggy
hill, its walls of toppled stone and **massive granite blocks** hinting at forgotten
battles and the clash of mighty armies. Now the ruins seem host only to **creeping
vines** and the **foul miasma** that drifts down from the keep.

The air is overrun with pestilence. **Fat flies bite at you** incessantly, and
**clouds of small black insects** choke your every breath. The long abandoned land
is choked with **thorny vines** that drape the sickly trees and hang from the ruined
walls. There is an **odor of rot and decay**, as if the hill itself were decomposing
from within.

::: inset  

  ![The ragged banner!](modules/ecr/packs/adventures/sotss/assets/other/beastmen%20flag%20(molan%20felan%20sable-a-skull-crimson).png)
:::

A sight gives you pause: **a ragged banner, depicting a crimson skull on a black
field**, stands high atop the ruined walls. Whatever lurks within has terrorized
you and your village for far too long. You turn to your companions and ready
your meager weapons. The time for retribution has come. 
::::

## The Ruined Keep

### General Features

The keep’s **walls rise 30'** from their
rammed earth embankments. The walls and all the fallen
stones are covered in a patchwork of moss, sickly vines, and lichen. Climbing them requires a **DC 15 climb check to avoid falling 20' for [[/r 2d6]] damage** before tumbling
down to the base of the rammed earth mound. Remember that each *6* rolled for fall damage indicates a broken bone.

Rather than simple carved blocks, the keep seems to
have been built of enormous standing stones and mighty dolmens.
The blocks are **fitted together crudely**, leaving cracks between
the stones for rotting vegetation and **pools of water** that
act as host to the **gnats and mosquitoes**.

#### Vision

**At night**, the keep is usually lit only by a few torches and whatever illumination the moon and stars deign to give. Tonight, due to the ritual taking place underneath the keep, a dim aurora adds some visibility. 

### Random Encounters

Roll [[/r 1d6]] every hour the characters are in or near the keep, and when something particularly 'loud' happens. On a *1*, a random encounter occurrs.

(LINK TO RUINED KEEP RANDOM ENCOUNTERS)

01. [[1d6+4]] beastmen carrying sacks, at limit of sight, approaching the keep. 1 sack holds a child, [[1d4]] hold frantically scrambling pets and small animals, the rest are filled with miscellaneous items worth [[1d6]] gp.
01. 1 flying beastman, in the air. If it gains surprise (50% in daylight, 100% in full night) it makes one attempt to grab a small PC or whatever the most vaulable item a character has is and flies down into the sinkhole laughing.
01. [[1d4]] 0-level villagers in hiding, desperate to escape. They have nothing but the rags they wear but can become additional characters if any players have lost too many.
01. 1 beastman champion following 3 tracking beastmen (wolf, dog, manta ray with a huge nose and centipede legs) on chain leashes. On surprise, he closes on the party, drops the chains, and all four attack at once. He has 3 spears and a longbow.
01. The well emits a pillar of disturbing light, which flashes three times before going out. This is followed by a deep bass rumble below the keep. Roll for random encounters again.
01. The mist around the sinkhole becomes becomes thicker, forming physical tentacles at the edges. These wrap around the stones (and PCs failing a DC 10 Reflex save who stand at the edge) and yank several in, widening the pit slightly.

### Approaching the Ruins

The PCs are free to enter as they see fit.

| Approach | Details |
|--|--
| Up the road, from the south | This, the most obvious approach, takes them up the causeway (LINK TO AREA A). This is also the most dangerous. Wily characters will be rewarded for their suspicion, though hesitation should never be mistaken for caution. |
| Through the crumbled wall, from the west | Part of the wall has crumbled, and entering this way requires the characters to ascend the rubble (LINK TO AREA B). Picking their way through the fallen blocks is not difficult, but carries its own risks as noted below. |
| Across the sinkhole, from the northeast | A lot of chutzpa and a lot of rope are needed to get past the smoking pit. (LINK TO AREA G) |
| Climbing the walls elsewhere | Each character must succeed on a **DC 15 climb check** or fall 20 feet for **[[/r 2d6]] damage**. Each *6* rolled results in a broken bone. |

# Creatures: Vine Horrors

Vine horrors are corpses animated by the foul
vines growing from seeds planted in their chests. The rotting
bodies serve both as nutritious hosts for the vines and as seed
pods for future vine horrors. They attack twice per round.

::: statblock creature vine-horrors
Vine Horrors (2): Init +2; Atk vine +2 melee (1d4); AC 13; HD
2d10; hp 10 each; MV 20’; Act 2d20; SP Entangle, Shambling, Death Throes; SV Fort +2, Ref +0, Will +2; AL C. 

* Entangle
    : If both vines strike the same victim in one round, they entangle the target, automatically inflicting [[/r 1d6]] points of crushing and choking damage on the following round. An entangled victim can win free with a **DC 15 Strength** check.

* Shambling
    : Vine Horrors are awkward and cannot use Action Dice to move, only to attack.

* Death Throes 
    : When killed, the host body of a vine horror spills out thousands of small seeds slick with mucus. The seeds become **unviable in 12 hours** but can move 1' per hour until then. If a seed reaches a corpse before expiring, the corpse rises as a vine horror in [[/r 1d4]] days.

::: 

::::

::: readaloud 
An old **dirt road**, now **overrun with weeds** and sickly vines, rises
towards the ruined citadel. A grisly sight bars your way: **a pair of bodies, 
secured to poles** by long ropey vines. The wicked **vines have wormed their way
inside** the bodies’ eyes, ears, and mouths.   
:::

#### Upon Closer Look...

::: readaloud
To your horror, *you realize the
bodies are still moving*.
:::

The vines unwind from the posts, freeing the
horrors to shamble toward the PCs. 

**Any PC from the village that gets a good look at the corpses recognizes them as the village blacksmith's children, Keary and Alban.** The brothers vanished from the village eleven days
ago. The beastmen killed the brothers and seeded their corpses
with vine horrors to ward off any investigations from the
townsfolk. 

::: loot
Treasure
: Keary’s corpse is still carrying a **short sword** and **dagger** (gifts forged by his father)

### Area B – Ruined Wall

::: area summary
The walls have crumbled here, but remain unstable.

Traps
: Unstable Rubble

Secrets
: Passage to B-1: The Vault
:::

::: readaloud
The keep’s **massive wall has collapsed here**, spilling cyclopean stone blocks down the rocky slope. The blocks are **precariously balanced** atop one another, like a titan’s game of dice. 
::: 

It is relatively simple work for the PCs to pick their way up the blocks and
enter the keep. 

:::: trap

***Unstable Rubble***

Several of the blocks are poised to shift if disturbed. Those
ascending the slope without noting the danger inevitably trigger a slide. One
false step and massive granite blocks tumble down the slope, crushing all in
their path. Clouds of choking dust fill the air along with the screams of the
dying and the deafening crash of stone against stone.

::: statblock trap
Unstable Rubble: Atk avalanche +5 melee
(1d10); SP Detectable, Triggerable, AOE, Destruction, Reveal.

* Detectable
    : Miners and dwarves **AUTOMATICALLY CHECK DC 8 INT** to recognize the unstable stones.
    : **DC 10 INT** for all others.

* Triggerable
    : Miners and dwarves can trigger the avalanche safely with a **DC 10 STR** check from the top of the pile.
    : **DC 20 STR** for all others.
    : Attempts to trigger the avalanche *unsafely* automatically succeed.

* AOE
    : Every character on or below the rubble is subject to the avalanche attack when triggered.

* Destruction
    : All items carried by creatures killed by the avalanche are destroyed.

* Reveal
    : Any search of the rubble after the avalanche has been triggered locates a narrow, rocky shaft descending 14 feet before opening into a small cave, area B-1.

### Area B-1 – Felan's Tomb

#### If PCs approach from above (Area B:)

::: readaloud
You squeeze down through the narrow opening, dropping into the
small cave below. The air is choked with chalky dust and the pervasive
smell of rot. A single shaft of light cuts through the swirling
dust to illuminate an enormous stone door set in a portal.
The portal is circumscribed in runes. At the center of the door is a
large pentagram inscribed within a circle. Both the runes and the
pentagram are set with silver and seem to glimmer faintly in the
dim light.
:::

#### If PCs approach from the southeast:

::: readaloud
A strange and foreboding portal bars your way. The portal is circumscribed
in runes. At the center of the portal is a large pentagram
inscribed within a circle. Both the runes and the pentagram are set
with silver and seem to glimmer faintly in the dim light.
:::

#### Reading the Runes

**Wizards**, their **apprentices**, **fortune-tellers** and **astrologers** may
attempt to decipher the runes with a successful **DC 12 INT** check:

::: translation

    the burning purge, which scours the earth
    the hardened glamour, stilling life
    the baleful storm, heedless to supplication
    the raging tempest, devourer from within
    banes four I place upon this gate:
    Fire, Ice, Storm and Hate

:::

On a failed check, the judge is encouraged to make up a partial, misleading translation.

#### Opening the Portal

Though heavy, the stone portal is not locked, and can be
opened with a **DC 20 STR** check. 

:::: trap

***The First Bane: Fire***

Forcing the door triggers
the first ward: a blast of flame engulfs the door!

::: statblock trap
Fire Bane: Atk fire ward +0 melee(1d10); SP Dodgeable, AOE.

* Dodgeable
    : Those hit may make a DC 15 Reflex save to avoid half the damage, scrambling away from the portal.

* AOE
    : All PCs within 10' of the portal are attacked by the fire ward.

:::
::::

#### Once the portal is open:

::: readaloud
As the last wisps of flame fade, you can make out a soft crackling
sound rustling in the chamber beyond. An icy chill settles over the
air and your breath condenses into misty clouds.
Through the portal you can make out a low funerary bier. A body
lies in repose atop the stone. The body was once a warrior of some
sort—it wears a suit of thick hide armor and clutches an enormous
battle axe to its chest.
The entire chamber sparkles with a soft, elfin glow.
:::

This chamber is the tomb of the warrior Felan, brother to Molan, 
and fellow chaos lord. Felan was killed in battle with the
forces of good and was entombed here to prevent his corpse’s
capture and desecration.
The elfin glow emanates from a hardened sheet of ice that
coats the entire chamber. Though there is no light source within
the tomb, the ice refracts the light from above, bathing
the entire chamber in a soft glow.

:::: trap

***Preternatural Cold***

As evidenced by the characters’ breath, the chamber is preternaturally
cold. The cold and ice pose three threats: paralysis, slick floors, and frostbite.

::: statblock trap
Preternatural Cold: Atk none; SP Paralysis, Slippery, Damage Over Time.

* Paralysis
    : Characters must make a **DC 12 Fortitude** save for every round spent within the chamber. Each failed save lowers the PC’s movement by 15 feet as his body succumbs to the cold. Once a PC’s movement drops to zero, he can no longer take any actions.

* Slippery
    : **DC 15 Reflex** save to walk across without falling down.
    : **DC 15 Reflex** save to stand up or assist someone who has fallen without falling back down.
    : Falling down requires 1 round to recover from before standing up again.
    : PCs may slide across the polished, hardened ice.

* Damage Over Time
    : **After 5 rounds**, each additional round of exposure causes each PC [[/r 1d4]] damage.
    : Extremely warm clothing alows **10 rounds** before damage begins.

:::
::::

Felan was an enormous man, nearly seven feet tall and muscled
like a bear. His hide armor is of excellent craftsmanship, 
sewn from the thick hides of basilisks and the fur of polar
worms. Felan’s enormous axe is forged of meteoric iron and obviously too heavy to be weilded properly without extraordinary strength.

::: aside item

# Felan's Axe

Felan’s enormous axe is forged of meteoric iron and **can only be wielded
by a character with a Strength score greater than 15.**. 

The terrible weapon inflicts
[[/r 1d10]] damage on a hit and **inflicts critical hits on a threat range expanded by 1**
(i.e., a natural roll of 19-20 for most characters, or 18-20 for a warrior or
dwarf who is already at a 19-20 crit range).

Escaping from the Keep with this weapon exposes a character to the ***curse of storm and hate***.

:::

#### Getting the Axe

A **DC 20 Strength** check is required to break the axe
free of the corpse. (This is particularly grisly, snapping Felan’s
icy fingers in the process.) 

#### Getting the Armor

Freeing the corpse and its armor is
even more difficult, requiring **two subsequent DC 23 Strength
checks**. Each attempt to free the axe or corpse from the ice
takes 1 round.

::: curse
Heroes escaping the tomb with either the axe or the armor are
subject to two last wards: the curse of storm and hate. Judges
are encouraged to create their own curse, specific to their
home campaign. Following are some sample curses to serve
as inspiration:

* The next time the PCs are at sea, their ship is overtaken by a fearsome storm.
  Just as their ship is torn asunder, the heroes see an image of Felan, 
  silhouetted in the heart of the clouds. To survive the PCs must make it to a
  jungle island, where ancient reptiles lie in wait.

* The wielder of the Axe of Felan is slowly overcome by his passions. At the
  judge’s choosing (at least once per adventure) the wielder must succeed on a
  DC 15 Will save or succumb to a violent rage, mindlessly attacking his foes
  and savagely pursuing them to the death.
  
* The next time the PCs are traveling
  through the wilderness, they are overtaken by towering thunderclouds on an
  otherwise clear day. Just before the rain starts to fall, the PCs spy the
  silhouette of Felan in the heart of the roiling black clouds. Then comes the
  lightning. Each PC that entered the tomb is attacked by a bolt of lightning:
  Atk lightning bolt +1 missile fire; dmg 2d10.

	Traps
	: Portcullis (dropped by beastmen on final rank of PCs)
	: Alarm Bell (beastmen ring it after dropping Portcullis)
:::

::: readaloud 
The dark, moss-eaten gatehouse towers above you, grim and
forbidding. Murder holes, fashioned in the likeness of looming toads, threaten
to gout forth flaming oil and tar. Black arrow slits pierce the high stone
walls. You can hear the flap of the heretical banner above, hidden from sight by
the vine-draped battlements. The ancient drawbridge has long since fallen away
into ruin, leaving only a few rotting planks placed across the ditch. The heavy
iron portcullis stands half-raised, the rusty spikes a mere four feet above
slots cut into the stone floor. 
:::

Two snarling beastmen lurk on the second floor of the gatehouse
(accessible only from the @Compendium[ecr.sotss-journals.Area H]{Tower of the Beast}). Cautious PCs pausing to
listen will hear animal-like sniffing sounds and the scratch of
claws on stone coming from above.

:::: trap

***Portcullis***

The beastmen wait for the PCs to enter, then drop the portcullis
on the last rank.

::: statblock trap
Portcullis: Atk portcullis -5 melee (1d6); SP AOE, Damage Over Time, Pinned.

* AOE
    : All characters under the portcullis are subject to attack.

* Damage Over Time
    : Every round a character remains pinned, they take [[/r 1d6]] damage.

* Pinned
    : Those hit by the portcullis are pinned and must be rescued.
    : **DC 23 STR** check by a single character to raise the portcullis and free those pinned.
    : **A total of 40 STR** among multiple characters all working to raise the portcullis will free those pinned.

:::
::::

#### After dropping the portcullis:

The beastmen toll a great bell.
This alerts their brothers to the PCs’ presence. Their work
done, the howling beastmen withdraw to area H.

### Area D – Courtyard: 

::: readaloud
The **courtyard is overgrown** with sickly
weeds and thick brambles. A **deathly silence** hangs in the air, as if
even the frogs and insects are afraid to draw attention to themselves.
The **smell of rotting vegetation** is pervasive, and the **ground sucks at
your boots** with every tentative step.
:::

Nearly all of the courtyard’s buildings have fallen into ruin. **A single
burnt-out shell set against the keep’s east wall is the only remaining
structure.** Set near the heart of the courtyard is a well, framed with
a crude pulley system. To the east is the keep’s sole standing tower.

***Heroes pausing to inspect the ground*** easily discover a muddy
trail leading from the gatehouse through the brambles to the
@Compendium[ecr.sotss-journals.Area H]{Tower of the Beast}.

The **small side trail** runs to the @Compendium[ecr.sotss-journals.Area F]{Well of Souls}.

The **muddy prints** indicate a wide variety of creatures: human
footprints, the tracks of large creatures with only three toes, 
hawk-like talons, and perhaps even the slithering trail of an
enormous snake. While seeming to hint at a variety of monsters, 
all the tracks belong to mutated beastmen.
