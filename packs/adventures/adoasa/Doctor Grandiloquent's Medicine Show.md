# Cast

## Doctor Grandiloquent

28, elaborately bearded, otherwise sexless. Similarly free of scruples. Former gravedigger and occasional graverobber. Learned rudiments of magic from Esme after liberating her from a box of precious woods buried with a church functionary. Denied access to greater secrets by wizards able to correctly assess his character, he must placate Esme's hungers in hope of becoming greater. 

Most of the magic the doctor knows requires a great deal of physical and mental sacrifice. He is incapable of supplying enough of that energy himself, but has learned rituals from Esme to allow him to extract it from others.

Some small fraction of his wares are actually effectual; he would prefer they all worked, but the number of deaths required to make that happen is simply too much work for him to contemplate.

The travelling nature of his medicine show have thus far kept him from pursuit.

## Esme

Ageless, unsettlingly Other, technically Succubus, driven to frustrate and ruin. Freed from captivity by the her Vassal, the graverobber now Doctor.

She taught the Doctor a ritual to extract life force and provide it to her, while using her own magic to invoke the results the doctor has come to expect.

She performs a vile and violent act as part of the medicine show requiring an additional fee to attend. Some members of the audience sometimes end spiritually or physically devoured.

## Simple Frederick

31, spindly, strong, visibly inbred. Musical savant. Performs improved versions of local songs on multiple instruments after hearing once. Performs for the Doctor's show. Desperately in an less than sentient approximation of love with Esme.

# The Situation Now

The medicine show has arrived at the literal end of the road. Four days' travel ago, the doctor refused to pay a bridge toll and was forced to take a dubious side path. It lead here, a village of a few families of fishermen, a useless harbor, and a fickle supply of fresh water. It's called Scalp Rock, but they haven't discovered that yet. The doctor wonders if putting on a show could possibly be profitable here, or if grabbing a person or a child or three and getting away before morning would be more productive.

The assets of the medicine show follow.tied
