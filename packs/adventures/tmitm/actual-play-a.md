The Elfward villagers found themselves in conflict with the Jale Sorcerer as both they and he sought quantities of True Phlogliston on the Dolm Planetoid. A spell hurled during heated combat with the Sorcerer turned the alien into a bosom friend. The Sorcerer excitedly offered to show them the Jale Planet aboard his traveling craft.

The Sorcerer took them to Moon Eu, which boasts an impressive view of Jale. A revolt among the Sorcerer's servants put an end to the planned brunch and a Moon Devil ripped the Sorcerer in half and chased the villagers into an open pore in Moon Eu's fleshy crust.

They now float in the microgravity of the Moon within a sphincter-filled tunnel, dead bacterial-skeletal symbiotes liquefying on the floor and a Moon Devil menaces from above.
