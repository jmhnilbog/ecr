The wider circle

#background

When and Where

It’s the morning of October 31, 1381, in a parallel England. Your characters are a mix of English drawn to the Goblin Market, to be held outside the village of Fulstow on Goshill Island (off the east coast of England, near Hull) for the next three nights. Most are villagers from Fulstow trying to make a buck off of visitors, some are ready to win some magic from the Goblins, some are just curious or in search of entertainment. None of them have any notable ‘adventuring’ skills, yet.
Playstyle Expectations

Your characters are out to survive and survive well. If they can convince others to run themselves through a meat grinder so they don’t have to personally, they are likely to and put off the consequences until later. They are unlikely to cooperate over the long term unless circumstances or interpersonal friendships make cooperation appropriate. The survivors of the current expedition don’t all have to become a band of wandering adventurers.
Where To Buy Things

Anything a neophyte adventurer might need can be bought at the Goblin Market, being held at Fulstow. Weapons and armor are not easily found in smaller villages, or even towns. Your best bet is the largest town on the island, Springwick, a day or so’s travel through forest. The nearest city is Kingston-Upon-Hull, about 15 miles away as the crow flies. You’ll need a boat or money for a ferry ride just to get to the mainland. You might need to go as far as Sheffield (80 miles) or London (215 miles) for really obscure or custom-fit items.
Famous Magicians Include...

The mightiest wizards are all fifth-dimensional lizard people, aka the English royal family. The Queen, Auria, is the mightiest among them. One of their courtiers, Phillip the Rebuker, is a great, ‘holy’, non-lizard person diabolist, certainly the most famous of those who openly deal with devils.
Where the Prayers Go

The state religion is Englishism, basically Roman Catholicism except all the big players have been revealed as fifth-dimensional lizard people and prayers actually work. Humans are from the moon, which used to be the Garden of Eden. (The moon is now populated solely by various snakes and snake hybrids.) Hell is underneath the Sun, and Heaven is in the Castor Group (a seven-star system, brightest in the galaxy. It takes good souls 51 years to travel there, as they are made of light.

Every chartered city or town must enforce the state religion and include several churches. Smaller settlements must at least raise a cross at the major crossroads. The farther you get from London, the weirder the interpretations of Englishism get. While no other major religions reliably answer prayers, scattered shrines to genius loci, devils, demons, or ancestors show evidence that magic is not restricted solely to Englishism and the fifth-dimensional reptiles.

Many common people subscribe more to cherry-picked local superstitions than Englishism in day-to-day lives, as clerics aren't present at all times to instruct and correct. Many invoke the Queen's name as a prayer.

The Queen's men roam the countryside, armed warriors and English clerics. Even the Queen travels with them one-third of the year. Justice is meted out, court cases are heard, healing and instruction delivered, and children with the reptilian DNA are taken to be raised as nobility.
English Heroes

Famously great warriors still walking include your island’s own Rupert Bough-Breaker, who moved an entire forest on his back in order to create the land on which Springwick developed. Christian Man-Ossuary wears armor made of the bones of duelists who lost to him. (He requires at least a single bone from any opponent, even in duels not to the death.) St. Four-Toes is a possibly legendary warrior said to have driven more snakes into Ireland. Anything he plants in the ground causes some sort of growth, and some sort of harvest.
Where Is the Money?

The richest are all fifth-dimensional lizard people and you will probably never meet them. The richest person you know of in Fulstow is Willelmus Chandler, patriarch of the largest family in Fulstow. He credits his incredible fecundity, his friendship with the local Earl, and his untiring effort as the reason for his great success. He certainly has the nicest, stone house you’ve seen.
Where Can I Get Healing?

Magical healing can be found at scattered sacred springs or in any settlement large enough to have a cleric-staffed church of Englishism. Affirmation of the tenets of Englishism is always required before any magic is invoked, usually including a full round of Confession, Confirmation, and Communion. Snake handling is part of the Rite of Confirmation, and those not doing proper penance are often bit. Adventurers and other of dubious morality often find themselves turning to Diabolism for magical healing. Hermits, wise-women, and talking animals are other possibilities, should you become cursed or dead. Englishism saved many, many people from the Black Death in England, and turned many of those into zealots for life.
Where Is The Magic?

There are no ‘Magic Guilds’ or the like. If you want guaranteed access to magic, you’d better get access to the Englishist church or develop a relationship with a magically-inclined demon. Spells and prayers are functionally identical. Working spells cost RP; if you know a spell, you can cast it as many times as you like in a day until you roll poorly enough to block it for the rest of the day.
Other Notable Types

Thieves do have guilds of sorts. They are often the best source of information about finding experts in various fields, including mercenaries. Mercs can be found roving the countryside acting as police forces, and in large settlements where several will have small outposts.
How To Get a Message From Here To There

Long-distance communication is dominated by Englishist church magic, which is monitored. Private long-distance communication is usually restricted to pigeon or horse.
Where To Get Drunk

Fulstow has greatly ramped up ale, beer, mead, and wine production in advance of the Goblin Market. There are no taverns, but pavilion tents have been set up, loaded with rustic benches and tables. The Market is sure to have drink as well, but most prefer to deal with Goblins with faculties undulled.
Any Famous Monsters Around?

Fulstow Forest is populated with a staggering number or birds of huge variety. Some are famously tricky, some famously dangerous. The Fulstow Beast is blamed for many injuries and deaths, and said to be a huge mongoose. Mongeese have a bad rap in England, since they kill snakes.
And Outside England's Borders....

Even though it was only founded at the turn of the 13th century, Englishism is the only known ‘working’ religion and it has rapidly spread to the Continent. France and Spain desperately attempt to squash it. Instead of bringing the fight to England, they are on the brink of civil collapse. The Black Plague killed few in England, thanks to it. France and Spain are greatly depopulated. Ireland and Scotland have already become part of England in all but name.
If You Just Want To Fight

There are no gladiatorial arenas or anything like them. Boxing, animal baiting, wrestling, and other sport contests do exist in the countryside, and nobles and city folk may attend knightly tournaments.
Things To Look For and Steal

The Englishist Church craves treasures that prove its legitimacy as much as the Holy Roman Church craves opposing evidence. Find a nail of the True Cross with a shred of snake-skin or a grail full of anti-venom and you have a ready-made buyer.

What Happened on Michaelmas, And What Is the Goblin Market

A short, ugly man with a strange cap appeared in the center of Fulstow at sundown. He waved his hat in the air and shouted, "Here, within the forest, at the clearing, the Goblin Market shall be held for three nights come All Hallows' Eve." Repeating this twice more, he walked away. While every villager in Fulstow can't have been within sight of the center of town at that moment, all remember being there.

A similar event ocurred in Hull, London, and scattered other small human settlements, naming Fulstow as the location of the Goblin Market.

Everyone knows the Goblin Market is a great, though frightening, opportunity to trade with the magical races and experience the usually unknowable. It appears every few years at a different place without rhyme or reason. The villagers of Fulstow will likely receive a boon from the Market if they host it well, and there will be many visiting outsiders to extract what cash they can from. Wizards, priests, entertainers, pilgrims, curiosity-seekers will all be there to deal with the Market.

While everyone knows about the Goblin Market, no one remembers anyone ever talking about the Goblin Market until that strange ugly man showed up.

# RULES

Please read #background before creating your characters.

Character Creation

Each player starts with three human characters. You get to spread five syllables' worth of positive traits among them, five syllables' worth of negative traits among them, and up to ten neutral syllables' worth among them. You can assign up to three syllables in a single trait.

Use a + or - to indicate a trait is a positive or negative one. Each positive syllable is used as a bonus to related activities, and each negative syllable is a penalty. Neutral syllables might be used as a bonus or a negative dpending on situations, or just be a revealed fact about the character. Positive or negative traits are a part of the character until changed; -poor would mean the character always goes back to being poor shortly after coming into any money. A neutral poor is just a description of the current state of the character.

+strong, one positive syllable, means the character is stronger than about 66% of the human population. +very strong, three positive syllables, means they are stronger than 99.7% of the human population. (Being human imposes limitations.)

Give your characters medieval English names: try something like https://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/name/#type=medieval_europe;medieval_europe=English Male for examples. You only really need a first name at this point.
basilisk\*07/31/2017
Example Characters

Edward: +large, +lovable, -slow, hairy, cook

Edward has 4 positive syllables, 1 negative syllable, and 2 neutral ones. Because +large is a positive trait, it will almost always act in ways that benefit him. He may have trouble finding armor that fits, but he's a bit stronger than average. And he is probably the best-loved villager in Falstow, even if he occasionally gets hair in the food he serves. Picking a profession as a positive or neutral trait gives certain starting inventory and is a good idea. Note that the more syllables a trait has, the more influential it is: a pastry chef is better than a mere cook.

Bernyce: +tough, -sour, -gossip, tall, underweight, toothless

Bernyce has 1 positive syllable, 3 negative syllables, and six neutral ones. She can take a pounding before succumbing to danger thanks to her +toughness. A nasty woman, she takes 3 syllables' worth of social penalties even as people come to her for -gossip. One syllable worth of tallness makes her a bit taller than average, while three syllables of underweight makes her very, very skinny, without a tooth in her head. Her height, build, and dentition will likely not come into play often, and they will be in her favor as often as they aren't. If she had -underweight instead, a negative trait, it would indicate her sickly nature and not just her body type.

Richyrd: -pale, bald, whines

Richyrd has 1 negative syllable and 2 neutral ones. His -paleness indicates a weak consitution, while his baldness is just a fact of life. His whines are annoying, but the rest of his personality must make up for it enough.

These three characters total 5 positive, 5 negative, and 10 neutral syllables.

Don't worry, I'll discuss any necessary tweaks or things to consider once characters are submitted. You can place your characters in #currentturn or message them to me directly.
basilisk\*08/01/2017
Character Progression

As your characters do things, they accumulate as Facts about them on their character sheets. Each fact is worth zero or more experience points, assigned by the GM. Characters can spend experience to promote a fact to a neutral trait, demote a neutral trait to a past fact, shift the polarity of a trait, or buy syllables for a trait.

Only XP from Facts associated with the trait you wish to modify can be spent on that trait! You need to make a case for it.
basilisk\*08/01/2017
Promote a Fact To a Neutral Trait

Facts are a record of things done, but do not influence ongoing gameplay...unless they are promoted to neutral traits. A fact might read, "Killed 15 rats." If promoted to a neutral trait, say, rat\*ter, the character has made a point of their rat-killing abilities and may be starting to be associated with rats, dead and/or alive. It's still just a neutral trait, but now it's not just a fact in the character's history, its a part of the character.

Promoting a fact to a neutral trait costs 3XP per syllable, minus 1.
Demote a Neutral Trait To A Past Fact

There is a limit to how many facets of personality a single character can keep going at once. If a character with the neutral trait thief decides to put that lifestyle behind, they may spend XP to remove it in exchange for the fact, "Used to be known as a thief."

Demoting a neutral trait to a past fact costs 3XP per syllable, minus 1.
basilisk\*08/01/2017
Shift the Polarity of A Trait

Negative traits can become neutral, neutral traits can become positive, positive traits can become doubleplus good traits. If a character with the positive trait +hurt wants to really get good at hurting people, they can spend XP to make that ++hurt. -Slow can become plain old slow. Fun can become +fun.

Shifting the polarity of a trait towards positive costs 3 XP per syllable _ 3XP per sign indicator.
Shifting towards negative costs only 2 XP per syllable _ 2XP per sign indicator.

ug*ly to +ug*ly: 6 _ 3 = 18XP
tough to +tough: 3 _ 3 = 9XP
+tough to ++tough: 3 * 9=27XP
+ug*ly to ++ug*ly: 6 * 9=54XP

ug*ly to -ug*ly: 4 * 4=16XP
basilisk*08/01/2017
Buy Syllables For A Trait

You can add or subtract syllables from existing traits by promoting facts. A ++thief can buy a syllable to become a ++robber.

Adding a syllable to a trait costs 3XP per syllable \* 3XP per sign indicator, minus 1.

++thief to ++rob*ber: 6 * 6 - 1 = 35XP.
basilisk\*08/01/2017
Relative Strengths Of Trait Types

- Neutral: +/- 1
- - : -3
- +: +3
- --: -9
- ++: +9

...and so on
basilisk\*08/01/2017
Limits to Trait Types

You can only have one + trait for every three neutral traits you have.
You can only have one ++ trait for every three + or - traits you have.
You can only have one +++ trait for every three ++ or -- traits you have.
And so on.
basilisk\*08/01/2017
Risk Points

Risk Points are a measure of your importance to the universe. Powerful creatures have more by definition. They refresh to maximum after a few hours of not doing anything risky, like a nap at home. Anything dangerous or upsetting can reduce current RP.

As long as your RP are above 0, you will only take Wounds from surprise and critical attacks, and Wounds are what kill or otherwise remove your character from play.

Average humans have 4-6 Risk Points.
Threat Level

Conflicts are adjucated by relative Threat Levels.

1: An unarmed, average human.
2: An armed human.
3: An armed and combat-trained human. (Think 1st level Fighter in D&D.)
5: A bear.
6: An armed, 9-foot-tall Ogre.
8: An androsphinx.
40: The Archbishop of Canterbury in his home dimension.
50: A demon prince.
100: Serpent Jehova.

Given threat levels assume characters are doing everything in their power to win in a conflict. An armed ogre attacking an androsphinx is a conflict of threat levels 6 and 8, but an armed ogre in a riddling contest with an androsphinx is a conflict of threat levels 2 and 8 unless the ogre is particularly smart.

Players and characters will not be able to judge on sight the threat levels of opponents -- if at all possible, wait and watch!

# current-turn

Rumors

- It's bound to rain before the end of the Market.
- The villagers are going to be outnumbered by visitors to the Market by sundown.
- The Queen is coming for the last day of the Market!
- One of those soldiers who showed up yesterday is a noble. You know, the ugly one.

The Goblin Market is supposed to be starting today, about twenty minutes' walk into the forest from the southern edge of Fulstow. No one, not even any of the more annoying village children or the louder, drunker visiting soldiers, went into the forest last night to try and catch the Market setting up.
This turn will last from dawn until about two in the afternoon, barring weirdness. What are your characters going to do? Here are the most obvious choices.

- See the Goblin Market as soon as possible. If a character wants to get out to that clearing and see what's going on out there, name what they hope to see there. Everyone has been gossipping and whispering about what the Goblin Market actually is and what it has for sale, but no one knows anything. Is your character hoping to find magic to curse a rival? Maybe they just hope goblins are really bad hagglers and they can trade a cow for some magic beans, or they just want to see something new. Tell me in a word or two: magic, wealth, love, entertainment...

- Stay in Fulstow working on final preparations or trying to earn a buck. Your characters should be helping with town prep. There's a few small tents set up in Chandler's fields, but many more people are on the way from all walks of life. They'll want fresh food, alcohol, service. Tell me, your character is...

  - Making ale. Ale is quick to make and quick to sell.
  - Tending animals. Some villagers need to make sure the animals survive and breed, your character is making the rounds of his neighbors and making sure the animals are ok.
  - Waiting at the road. There is money to be had if one can ingratiate oneself with a wealthy visitor at the start of their visit.
  - Tending the shrine. In all the excitement, the cross at the center of town was knocked over and damaged by an upset horse. You've been drafted to repair it, quickly, before any clergy appear.
  - Daily life. You have things to do! The Market silliness can wait.

- Something else. Maybe a character wants to hide in the forest around the clearing and just watch the Market from afar all day. Maybe they want to become pick-pockets and cut-purses. Maybe you decided to pick +undead for one of your traits and now you're hiding in your hut, scared of the sun or of anyone discovering your gigantic headwound? Maybe they just want to use the excitement to run the hell away. Aim low if your character is going this route. Just tell me.
  I'd really like to start off the first turn with everyone participating...please have your questions and character intent by 20:00EST tomorrow (Aug 23) so I can get writing! Thanks, Heather!

While I'm getting this started, I'm going to give a brief overview of what's going to happen before I make any rolls (esp. since the system is evolving.)
I have done random encounter roll stuff, but nothing where there's a conflict involving the characters.
basilisk*08/25/2017
At the shore:

08:30. Cily makes it to the shore with a basket full of cakes in one hand and an empty bucket in the other. The first boat from Great Britain is still about ten minutes from shore. Turned over, the bucket makes a nice seat to watch the scramble of debarcation and sell her little cakes to the visitors. Three other villagers are finishing up a rough floating pier; one buys a cake.
08:40. Gemma arrives with a similar basket of similar cakes right before the first boat makes a landing. The two women quickly decide that each of them is going to sell her cakes before the other.

08:42. The first boat lands with five visitors. Poor peasants bringing their own food and saving what money they have for the Market, they nod but mostly ignore the women. The boat heads back to the mainland. The pilot says to expect more boats all day, as there are are at least fifty more people waiting.
09:15. Another boat arrives, debarks, returns home. The crowd on the far shore is increasing in size. Cily and Gemma start managing to sell a few cakes.

(Three groups of visitors in particular arrive around noon; the interactions Cily and Gemma have with them will determine who sells out of cakes first. Cily isn't as smart as Gemma; Gemma can be disturbingly lewd. Cily is at a -1 disadvantage if selling to 'average' people; they are on equal footing if customers pick up on Gemma's unwholesome vibe. )

At Hereward's shack at the edge of town:

07:05. Hereward tries to numb himself, drinking some brandy he had stashed away long ago.

07:20. A knock at the door. A strange collaboration of small mammals (chipmunks, rabbits, mice, squirrels) and teeny tiny dandies riding them is in his field, the leader of whom is at his doorstep. He introduces himself as Winkle and asks for directions to the Goblin Market. A confused Hereward points the way and Winkle thanks him, handing him some dried leaves in thanks. As he does that, Winkle recognizes Hereward as someone who died exactly at sundown, meaning he is not part of the living or the dead. Winkle and Hereward have a few drinks together and Winkle explains a bit about Hereward's condition.
basilisk*08/26/2017
(Being undead gives Hereward a +2 to resist liquor, but he has no bonuses to social interactions. They'll have up to three draughts of fairy liquor together, if Hereward manages not to offend Winkle before that. He'll learn something about his undeath and/or how to fix it with each drink.)
In Fulstow:
09:00. Narder arrives at the center of town in order to assist in putting the cross back up.
09:10. Elizabeth comes by to offer help (though she is more interesting in watching and commenting.)
09:15. A loud visitor (no one gets his name) starts shouting for assistance in putting up the central pole support for his very large tent, nearby. Narder, noticing a few attractive faces in the visitors now trickling through town, volunteers to show off his strength.
(Narder has about a 60% chance of assisting without any complications, a 25% chance of embarrassment and a 5% chance of incurring some sort of minor injury.)
10:00 Elizabeth watches the tent's progress and runs a few small errands. A new cross has been assembled and all that's needed is some whitewash.
11:15 Elizabeth starts painting the cross and greeting visitors. Before she can finish painting, a spooked horse smashes the cross....again.
(Elizabeth needs to get out of the way -- she has about an 80% chance of doing so without any trouble. Injury is unlikely.)
At the Market:
basilisk*08/27/2017
10:45. The path to the clearing is nearly silent. You look down to avoid a low-hanging branch on the path, are unsettled by sudden sound, look up, and you're there. The Market is continuously busy, crowded, full of more strangers than can possibly be here yet; there were only fifty or so visitors camped in the village last night. It's tough to get a good idea of how large the Market even is. The clearing might have changed size?
Tents, puppet shows, wagons, carts, booths. Some are staffed by normal folk, some by people of odd sizes, with strange eyes, or features. Some are loud and some are quiet. Most have ill-defined things for sale.
Edgar, Sybenn, Riffin, Symas, Wolfstanus, Lettice, and Miuccia have all made it to the Market by now, separately.
basilisk*08/27/2017
11:00 Symas finds himself in a press of people and tries to snatch a belt-purse. Wolfstanus, in the same press, does likewise at the same time. They might accidentally swipe from each other.
11:10.Edgar and Symas recognize each other as they are ushered into a tent. Inside is a full crowd, dead-eyed, staring at an empty, small stage. The crowd starts to leave, ignoring questions, rudely pushing past the two villagers. They find themselves alone in the tent. Then they notice they can't hear anything outside of the tent.
11:15. Riffin, Symas, and Miuccia all run into each other.
basilisk*08/27/2017
11:16. A juggler -- bad teeth, funny shoes -- starts performing for the three of them. A barker yells of a captive one-thousand-year-old man in his nearby, overturned wagon. Three clubs spin in the air; the juggler's art. He locks eyes with one of the villagers and shrugs, letting the clubs fall. Three flat stones are now in his hands instead. He starts to juggle them. His eyes close and his head hangs as if the juggler has just gone to sleep. The juggling continues.

(One of the three will be chosen.)

The barker's voice is just a mumble. The word 'led' or 'lead' is heard with clarity, the juggler's arms pantomime the rocks having greatly increased weight. Even so, he juggles faster and faster.

(Miuccia, unnerved, will attempt to walk away. They have about a 10% chance to do so.)

The juggler awakens, catches all three rocks in his mouth, swallows, and holds something out to the characters in his hands.

11:35. Lettice and Wolfstanus notice a circle of excited people and draw closer to see what looks like a game of marbles being played. There's a small man in red and yellow stripes leading it, asking for a lock of hair from each participant as payment to play; a bald visitor curses and walks off. "Next round, right up, right up, one more place, two more places? Two more places. A curl a play, a lock a play."

A rail-thin, dark man, a child from the village, and a fox-faced rogue crouch around two-thirds of a large chalk circle. Each has a tiny figurine before them.
(Lettice and Wolfstanus can join the game in exchange for a bit of hair, or just watch and see.)

On the shore:

11:20. Gemma and Cily stiull have plenty of cakes on hand, but are enjoying the excitement of new people and lots of boat traffic. There are at least three boats shuttling back and forth, one large enough to carry horse-and-wagon traffic. The latest boat dropped off five scraggly, surprisingly pale pilgrims.

It turns out that they aren't actually pale. They're covered in flour, part of their sect's devotions to Jesus Christ of the Loaves. It's a very glutinous sect. They get very excited at the two women offering cakes as a sign that they were right in coming to the Market.

Cily and Gemma compete to sell some cakes.

Cily and Gemma have the same social challenge ratings, 10. They roll initiative (3d6) and both get 11. Gemma wins, as she gets +1 to social intiative for being +sly and Cily loses -1 for being -dumb.

Gemma rolls 3d6 (10), which does 1d3-2 plot armor damage...negative damage is done to herself. She rolls -1! Gemma now has 7/8 plot armor.

Gemma steps in front of the pilgrims, speaking rudely about Cily's cakes and the attributes they lack. They comment on her boldness and look to Cily.

Cily rolls 3d6 (7), which does -1d4-1 (-2) plot armor damage. Neither Gemma nor Cily is much of a saleswoman. Cily now has 3/5 plot armor.

Cily thinks up something great to say, stutters a few times trying to sound grand, and accidentally drops a cake in the mud. The pilgrims are horrified and run/walk past both women, shouting all the way.
basilisk\*08/28/2017
12:05. Gemma and Cily glare at each other, each eating a cake. Another boat lands, bearing a horse-drawn cart, a blacksmith, and his three siblings/armed guards.

Cily and Gemma spring upon them, ready to sell some friggin' cakes.

Initiative is rolled as a tie again (14), but Gemma gets +1 and Cily gets -1, so Gemma goes first.

Gemma is first on her feet.

She rolls a 6, then a 3. This translates to her losing another 4 plot armor, leaving her at 3/8.

Gemma slips in some unfortunately-churned, wet mud and Cily rushes over to make her pitch.

Cily rolls an 8, then a 1. She loses another point of plot armor, leaving her at 2/5.

Cily is completely ignored as the cart rolls past the women, to more laughter from the dock.
basilisk\*08/28/2017
1:10 The women sourly eat cakes, ready to give up and return to town when the next boat disgorges more visitors. One confused-looking gentleman with the air of a hermit asks them if they are selling those lovely cakes and might he have one and how much are they if they don't mind?

Cily wins initiative this time (14 vs. 9).

Gemma's mouth is working around too much dry cake to answer before Cily can.

Cily rolls a 9 and a 1, dealing 1 point of plot armor damage to Gemma.

Cily hushes Gemma's cake-muffled sales pitch and asks the hermit what he might have to trade, as he doesn't look the sort to carry money.

Gemma is down to 2/8 plot armor and decides not to risk any more points with a bad roll.

The hermit pulls a very tiny, decorated and iced cake from a grimy pouch and offers it for one of Cily's cakes. She is surprised and asks the hermit why he hasn't eaten it himself. He tells her that it's not for him, and points out Cily's name on it in tiny, tiny sugar letters.

Cily is incredibly happy at the trade. (Restoring 1d4 plot armor points. (Now at 4/5)).

The hermit has some magic (+il•lu•sion) that the women can attempt to resist. The spell is CR 15, +3, 3PA. Neither Gemma nor Cily manage positive results.

The hermit eats all of Cily's remaining cakes in a single gulp and looks to Gemma. "Oh, and your cakes look lovely as well. Would you accept these in exchange?" He shows her a tiny acorn inscribed, 'Gemma'.

Gemma plays it safe and doesn't engage in a challenge with this weirdo. Her cakes aren't worth it.

Gemma takes the acorn and hands over the cakes. The hermit eats them all in one bite. He heads towards the village, commenting all the while that he is still hungry. (Gemma gets back 1 point of plot armor, leaving her at 3/8.)

The two women wait until another boat of armed men lands ashore before walking back to the village.
Cily gains fact: 2XP - Traded a bunch of cakes for a very fancy cake with her name on it.
Gemma gains fact: 1XP - Traded a bunch of cakes for a weird acorn with her name on it.
basilisk\*08/28/2017
7:21. Hereward pours a teeny-tiny cup of brandy for his visitor and drinks a normal-sized cup himself.

(Normal brandy is CR 5, 1. Hereward rolls and is unaffected by the booze.)

"You know, your sort had better not tread on hallowed ground."
07:22. The tiny man suggests a slug of his own brandy be shared...

(Fairy brandy is CR 12, 2. Hereward rolls 5d6, keeping the lowest 3: 8. 8 means he rolls 1d3-2, getting 1. He just barely squeaks by being affected by the booze.)

"That's the stuff. Ya haven't any iron on you, I hope? No, you'd have dropped dead if ye did, wouldn't ya?"
basilisk\*08/28/2017
07:23. One last drink, and the little man must go.

(Hereward rolls terribly, losing 3 plot armor.)

Hereward coughs liquor all over the little man. and passes out.
basilisk*08/30/2017
Hereward gains fact: 1XP - Drank with a fairy, learned a bit about undeath, and got a few dried leaves.

It’s the morning of October 31, 1381, in a parallel England. Your characters are a mix of English drawn to the Goblin Market, to be held outside the village of Fulstow on Goshill Island (off the east coast of England, near Hull) for the next three nights. Most are villagers from Fulstow trying to make a buck off of visitors, some are ready to win some magic from the Goblins, some are just curious or in search of entertainment. None of them have any notable ‘adventuring’ skills, yet.

Your characters are out to survive and survive well. If they can convince others to run themselves through a meat grinder so they don’t have to personally, they are likely to and put off the consequences until later. They are unlikely to cooperate over the long term unless circumstances or interpersonal friendships make cooperation appropriate. The survivors of the current expedition don’t all have to become a band of wandering adventurers.

Anything a neophyte adventurer might need can be bought at the Goblin Market, being held at Fulstow. Weapons and armor are not easily found in smaller villages, or even towns. Your best bet is the largest town on the island, Springwick, a day or so’s travel through forest. The nearest city is Kingston-Upon-Hull, about 15 miles away as the crow flies. You’ll need a boat or money for a ferry ride just to get to the mainland. You might need to go as far as Sheffield (80 miles) or London (215 miles) for really obscure or custom-fit items.

The mightiest wizards are all fifth-dimensional lizard people, aka the English royal family. The Queen, Auria, is the mightiest among them. One of their courtiers, Phillip the Rebuker, is a great, ‘holy’, non-lizard person diabolist, certainly the most famous of them. The state religion is Englishism, basically Roman Catholicism except all the big players have been revealed as fifth-dimensional lizard people and prayers actually work. Humans are from the moon, which used to be the Garden of Eden. (The moon is now populated solely by various snakes and snake hybrids.) Hell is underneath the Sun, and Heaven is in the Castor Group (a seven-star system, brightest in the galaxy. It takes good souls 51 years to travel there, as they are made of light.

Famously great warriors still walking include your island’s own Rupert Bough-Breaker, who moved an entire forest on his back in order to create the land on which Springwick developed. Christian Man-Ossuary wears armor made of the bones of duelists who lost to him. (He requires at least a single bone from any opponent, even in duels not to the death.) St. Four-Toes is a possibly legendary warrior said to have driven more snakes into Ireland. Anything he plants in the ground causes some sort of growth, and some sort of harvest.

The richest are all fifth-dimensional lizard people and you will probably never meet them. The richest person you know of in Fulstow is Willelmus Chandler, patriarch of the largest family in Fulstow. He credits his incredible fecundity, his friendship with the local Earl, and his untiring effort as the reason for his great success. He certainly has the nicest, stone house you’ve seen.

Magical healing can be found at scattered sacred springs or in any settlement large enough to have a cleric-staffed church of Englishism. Affirmation of the tenets of Englishism is always required before any magic is invoked, usually including a full round of Confession, Confirmation, and Communion. Snake handling is part of the Rite of Confirmation, and those not doing proper penance are often bit. Adventurers and other of dubious morality often find themselves turning to Diabolism for magical healing. Hermits, wise-women, and talking animals are other possibilities, should you become cursed or dead.

There are no ‘Magic Guilds’ or the like. If you want guaranteed access to magic, you’d better get access to the Englishist church or develop a relationship with a magically-inclined demon. Spells and prayers are functionally identical. Working spells cost RP; if you know a spell, you can cast it as many times as you like in a day until you roll poorly enough to block it for the rest of the day.

Thieves *do* have guilds of sorts. They are often the best source of information about finding experts in various fields, including mercenaries. Mercs can be found roving the countryside acting as police forces, and in large settlements where several will have small outposts.

Long-distance communication is dominated by Englishist church magic, which is monitored. Private long-distance communication is usually restricted to pigeon or horse.

Fulstow has greatly ramped up ale, beer, mead, and wine production in advance of the Goblin Market. There are no taverns, but pavilion tents have been set up, loaded with rustic benches and tables.

Fulstow Forest is populated with a staggering number or birds of huge variety. Some are famously tricky, some famously dangerous. The Fulstow Beast is blamed for many injuries and deaths, and said to be a huge mongoose. Mongeese have a bad rap in England, since they kill snakes.

Even though it was only founded at the turn of the 13th century, Englishism is the only known ‘working’ religion and it has rapidly spread to the Continent. France and Spain desperately attempt to squash it. Instead of bringing the fight to England, they are on the brink of civil collapse. The Black Plague killed few in England, thanks to it. France and Spain are greatly depopulated. Ireland and Scotland have already become part of England in all but name.

There are no gladiatorial arenas or anything like them. Boxing, animal baiting, wrestling, and other sport contests do exist in the countryside, and nobles and city folk may attend knightly tournaments.

The Englishist Church craves treasures that prove its legitimacy as much as the Holy Roman Church craves opposing evidence. Find a nail of the True Cross with a shred of snake-skin or a grail full of anti-venom and you have a ready-made buyer.


Game rules are still developing. Since you may not be able to judge your chances to succeed at things, I’ll offer approximate percentage chances for success on likely actions before anyone makes an attempt. Two average peasants scuffling with knives will take about three rounds of attacks before one dies or otherwise leaves the scene. A lucky attack might take one out in the first round. At least one combatant is likely to take a major wound before combat ends. Even without a decisive blow, one will almost certainly run off after six rounds.

Instead of Hit Points, this system uses ‘Risk Points’ and ‘Wounds”. Near misses, attacks that connect, anything hazardous physically or psychically can drain Risk Points. Likewise, rest, entertainment, carousing can all restore Risk Points. They fully-refresh after a night’s sleep in safety. While you have Risk Points, you are mostly safe from actual physical or psychic ‘Wounds’, though things like critical hits may cause them. When you’re at zero or fewer RP, every successful attack of any kind will cause Wounds. Psychic Wounds (despair, intrusive thoughts, active charm spells, fear effects, phobias, etc.) are also possible and just as potentially fatal. Individual wounds are tracked. Minor wounds take a week or simple magic to heal, major wounds take a month or complex magic to heal, mortal wounds may immediately remove a character from play and, if survived, may be permanent without major magical intervention.

Each minor wound gives a -1 to related activities, each major wound a -2, and each mortal wound a -5. Specific wounds may have additional penalties.

Combat is adjudicated by assessing relative risks; an armed human is more dangerous than an unarmed one, an average ogre is twice as dangerous as an average human.

Want a first-level fighter type? Give him a one-syllable fighty-descriptor like ‘++hurt’. When you get an chance to add another positive syllable, swap that for something like ‘++fighter’. The equivalent of a 10th-level fighter in this system might have ‘++Puissant Master of Rose Myrmidons` (10 syllables) as a descriptor. 

Similarly, ‘++thief’ to `++pilferer` (3rd level thief equivalent), `++mage` to `++Wizard Exemplary Grand Herald of The Fourth Golden Phylactery` (18th level wizard equivalent), `++serf`, `++partially free agriculturalist` (11th level commoner equivalent)

If you want to get better at something, add more syllables to the descriptor describing it. You won’t get better at fighting just by climbing levels. Adding syllables to your thief descriptor will make you better at stealing only — finding contacts to buy and sell illegal items, making contacts with and steering interactions with other thieves, casing likely targets, pickpocketing, hiding, hiding out, escaping prisons.

(++ descriptors aren’t given out to starting characters. They have double the impact of +descriptors.)

Example creatures:

Reginald the Peasant
Human +tough, -surly, drunk, bald
Danger: 1 (+1 when armed with knife)
Risk Points: 9 (6, +3 for tough)
Wounds (Save 10 +3 for tough)
	Minor: 1/2 (1 for Human body, +1 for tough) Bruised Left Shin, healing in 3 days
	Major: 0/2 (1 for Human body, +1 for tough)
	Mortal: 0/1 (1 for Human body)

Reginald is usually drunk or hungover and leverages that into angry disrespect for his injuries. He badly cracked his shin on the corner of his bed a few days ago and is still walking with a slight limp. 

Ug the Ogre Champion
Ogre ++warrior, +very tough, +strong, -very drunk
Danger: 6 (2, +3 for warrior, +1 for strong, +3 for very tough, -3 for very drunk) (+3 when armed with ogre-sized sword)
Risk Points: 33 (12, +18 for warrior, +3 for strong, +9 for very tough, -9 for very drunk)
Wounds (Save 10 +9 for very tough)
	Minor: 0/5 (2 for Ogre body, +3 for very tough)
	Major: 0/5 (2 for Ogre body, +3 for very tough)
	Mortal: 0/2 (2 for Ogre body)

A ten-foot mass of skin oils and muscle, Ug was trained to fight by a now-dead necromancer while kept liberally intoxicated. He now works as a drunken mercenary. He’s even more dangerous when sober, as unlikely as finding him that way may be.

An example combat between Reginald and Ug:

Ug has been hired to destroy a small border village to sow seeds of war. Reginald lives in one of the homes on the outskirts of town, one which Ug would like to claim as his temporary home for the few days he’ll need to find each home and deal with the inhabitants of before planting evidence that another nation was behind it. Reginald woke up as Ug’s approach shook the ground and hid in his loft, holding a knife tightly.

Ug tears the rickety door off the hovel (DC 5, which a +strong Ogre beats automatically) and starts looking around. Reginald sees only two chances to get out of here alive: jump from the loft while Ug is under it and run out the doorway before Ug gets him or hide until Ug starts looking in the loft and try to surprise him with the knife. Still being drunk, Reginald overconfidently tries the sneak attack route.

Ug tries the loft ladder, but the first slat breaks under his weight. He tests the loft floor, and hoists himself up. Reginald takes his chances, springs from the hay he’s hiding under, and attacks.

Reginald rolls a 15, +3 for the surprise maneuver, an 18. That does 3 RP to Ug, and because this was a surprise attack, might deal a Wound as well. Ug rolls a Wound Save. He needs a 13. (10 + the RP damage done.) He rolls a 4, +9 for being very tough, giving him exactly what he needed to roll. No wound is done. Reginald is trouble. He leaps out of the hay, surprising Ug, doing 3 RP but failing to actually hit the ogre.

They roll initiative. Reginald: 4, Ug, 14. Uh-oh, Ug goes first.

Ug lets go of the loft edge and pokes his sword at Reginald. He’s tall enough to do it. Ug rolls a natural 20, (modified to 32 for ++warrior and +strong, dealing 20 RP) which automatically connects and causes a wound. Reginald is almost certainly a goner at -11RP. He needs to roll better than 30 (10 + the RP damage done) in order to avoid a worse wound. With his +3 for toughness he can’t do that, but a natural 20 will still succeed. He rolls a 14. Ouch. He’s taken at least a major wound. He rolls another Wound Save, a 1 this time. He’s taken at least a mortal wound. Next, a 2. Reginald takes an instantly-fatal mortal wound as he’s impaled on the huge sword.

Ug leaves his sword sheathed in Reginald as he breaks up the furniture to clear space and get the fire really going so he can enjoy cooked serf for supper.

The next night, Ug finds himself surrounded by villagers in an open field after a poorly-planned raid on an alewife. They aren’t trained, but they’re armed with pitchforks, spears, and rocks, and there are a lot of them. Ug sees his only chance is to get the hell out of there quickly.

10 villagers
Human 
Danger 1 (+1 with pitchfork, spear, or rocks)
Risk Points: 6
Wounds: (Wound Save 10)
	Minor: 0/1
	Major: 0/1
	Mortal: 0/1

Four villagers win initiative before Ug. One rock comes close enough to do 1 RP and risk a wound. Ug rolls a 2 on his Wound Save and takes a minor wound, a bruised jaw. The villagers cheer until Ug gives the rock-throwing villager the bums’ rush.

He charges at her, hoping to knock her out of the way so he can flee. He rolls a 2, though, and makes himself an easy target the rest of the round. (He takes 3 RP damage at the surprise failure!) The other six villagers attack!

Three of them hit for a total of 8RP. One spear hit threatens a wound, and Ug rolls a 1 for his Wound Save, upgrading it from minor to major. Ug has a major wound, a bloody impalement to his left forearm.

Ug’s status:
Risk Points: 21/30
Wounds:
	Minor: 1/5 (Bruised Jaw)
	Major: 1/5 (Speared Left Forearm)
	Mortal: 0/2

In round 2, six peasants attack before Ug can try to run off. None manage to hit him, though one causes him to lose another 1 RP in a close dodge. Ug succeeds in shoving a woman into other peasants and getting out of the press. (She takes 10RP and a major wound, breaking an arm as she falls.) The four remaining peasants throw rocks as Ug flees, doing 5 RP. They jeer the fleeing ogre; if he cared about them at all, they might manage to do some RP damage to him by doing so.
