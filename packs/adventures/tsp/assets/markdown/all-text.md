* ring of trees, 10' thick, filled with brush
* opening dead ahead
* 'Knight' has moved to the back, throws helmet and dagger towards the back of the party. Says you have to get rid of the palanquin, he will wait 24 hours before leaving. Apologies and explanations can wait until then. He runs out of the palanquin's zone of influence. Palanquin will no longer move backwards...only straight ahead. Remaining guards will be influriated and fire arrows at the fleeing Knight before lurking at the back of the pack and yelling at the villagers to keep moving.
* crater/field filled with brawling villagers, guards, broken bits of palanquin wood. new ones show up every 2d4 rounds. 2x party size. 1/2 are unarmed and deranged, 1/2 are armed about as well as the party. New groups are about as big as the party +/- 2d4. They spend 1d2 - 1 rounds confused before joining in the melee. Fighting won't accomplish much, other than a chance to get more rolls on the random item charts as treasure. One Luck check to run through a take an attack, Two Luck checks to make it through. Palanquin & bearers will not be touched, but will take at least 4 rounds to cross the crater. Up to 8 humans can crouch safely under the palanquin and not be attacked. Once palanquin reaches cave, the next group of villagers arrives and the focus of the melee moves towards them...only villagers failing a Luck check might be attacked after this. Each villager has a 25% chance of a glinty bit somewhere. Unarmed villagers who damage someone have a chance of passing on Wet Malaise.
* cave mouth, palanquin items start glowing faintly, enough to read by for 10' then just enough to see for another 20'. 
* cavern tunnel: goes at least 200'. some sort of trap here. Silver mirror can be seen from 100' away in the dark.
* chalk line: chalk powder everywhere on floor. 3" deep gouged chalk line on floor. (it has been inscribed millions of times in various universes pinched close here.

Wet Madness: a disease new to this dimension, though very common in many close ones. Runny eyes, swollen brains, cannibalism. Basically rabies that's only fatal on failing a DC5 Fort save. Onset: 2d24 hours, Step: 1 day, -1d3 Per, +1d3 Str, -1d3 Con, 2 saves required. 2 saves failed = paralysis. Better tie up the sick.

glinty bits may be found as random treasure on villagers, in tunnel, or with the Pit.

glinty bits resolve into actual 'treasure' when brought back through the dimensional prism.

values are 1d100gp.

Bits resolve into small items, mundane in their original universe. Roll on a salvage table, then a random universe, then a value. Combine those into something interesting.

(bag of tiny mummified frogs) x (Nocturnal) x 20 = a mummified frog with huge empty eye sockets. At least one smaller frog is visible in its mouth.

(loaded dice) x (slow) x 100 = stone dice that move 1/3 of the speed they should. Practicing with them can allow the user to pick a result and roll it with a luck check.

(wooden leg) x (future) x 10 = a plastic artificial foot.

(book) x (nude) x 45 = a sketchbook filled with beautiful nudes of men with 12 fingers.

Full value of glinty bits is only realized if sold to an expert in dinemsional travel.

Hello! Hope I read everyone's email addresses correctly. I will be creating a website for this soon but my connection is complete garbage right now, so it'll have to wait a day or so. Don't worry overmuch about the way I've written up the player characters, I'll explain that next time.

I'm going to do another pass on the description of the session but wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything important. Let me know if you have any major edits! (I've named the guards -- the characters can be assumed to have overheard them talking amongst each other enough to catch their names.)

Day 1 (12th day of Harvest, 27th year of the Bear)

Weirdness in Elfward

The Principality of Gonde is a small, feudalist country at the fringes of the lands settled by man. Cloud's End is a small town at the edge of the fringes, where the Gonde River shrivels and drains underground at the edge of the Old Wood, no longer navigable. A vague cart-track runs ten miles further as the woods close about it. It leads to the forgettable and mostly forgotten farming village of Elfward.

At noon, a group of armed men appeared in the center of Elfward. Four rheumy, sallow children in rough yellow shorts followed them, bearing an elegant wooden palanquin covered in elaborate silver filigree on weary shoulders. This was the most interesting thing to happen in Elfward in a very long time. Most of the villagers kept their distance, hiding in their homes, peeping out though waxed-paper windows or watching at a distance from behind a conveniently-distant tree.

A red light bloomed within the palanquin behind delicate curtains. Everything else faded into the background. Silhouetted behind the curtains was a small figure wrapped in robes topped with a cylindrical cowl or hood, waving a thin arm arrhythmically
 as discordant sounds poured from it. Some fifteen of the villagers found themselves drawn by the eerie non-music. They moved forward and watched, rapt, for the hours the light and howling song went on. The guards took what food they could from the village. At mid afternoon the singing stopped and the fifteen mesmerized villagers followed the palanquin, its occupant, its guardians, and its bearers southeast as the rest of Elfward whispered occasional confusion and regret.

A rivulet of the Gonde river feeds a small lake near Elfward, directly in the path of the party. Forced to go around it, the singer in the palanquin gurgles and cries every moment it is not moving in a straight line towards whatever its goal is. The group finds itself at the outskirts of the Old Wood, pausing. The 'leader' of the armed men, head hidden by a large metal helm, whispered under his breath as he made a small cut on each of the villagers' hands, and forced them to smear their blood on the side of the palanquin. His soldiers tied the villagers loosely up and started deeper into the wood as the villagers began to come back to their senses.

Outskirts of the Old Wood

Even in the lightly forested edge, they moved slowly, only able to go at the pace of the children carrying the palanquin. Barely a couple of miles into travel, one of the armed men's horses stepped in an animal den, snapping a foreleg. It was put down, by way of a large rock.

The forest thickened quickly after that. Some of the villagers (Kyle Rhett, Heathcliff Gangwish, and the Slave) got out of their ropes and made a break for it. Heathcliff and Kyle slipped behind a tree as the rest of the group kept walking, seemingly uninterested in them. The Slave kept running. Some connection to the blood smeared on the palanquin began causing them increasing pain as the distance increased between them and the palanquin. The Slave ran until he dropped dead. Heathcliff snuck back into line. Kyle hung back. 

Camping in the Wood

Camp was made. The leader in the helmet was seen pacing out a circle around the camp, holding his silvered knife, as a fire was built and meat was cooked and distributed. Kyle ran to camp from the forest, spooking Winston; Winston accidentally killed the hapless woodcutter with a very, very well placed sling bullet. (Said bullet turned out to be the weird rock Kyle had lost somehow.)

Two guards kept first watch, while some of the villagers tried to stay up. The villagers all dreamed of spinning stars in the sky, of looking for lost body parts, differing for each. All woke at almost the exact same time...those fastest awake saw the whisper-thin layer of ice coating all the sleepers, and how it melted as soon as the dreamer awakened.

Later in the night, a red blob fell out of a tree next to Heathcliff Gangwish. Alaina Mark, a fugitive from who-knows-what, investigated it with a stick and got killed by it, taking one of the guards with him. The blob dissolved both of them, growing to triple its original size. It seemed only to want to approach the fire, however; the remaining guards lit a small fire off to the side to lead it away, then set it aflame.


The leader, done with all this nonsense, stabbed his silver knife into the palanquin, causing some sort of messed-up magic wave to knock all the villagers out for the rest of the night.

Rest In Peace

The Unknown Slave. Untied himself and ran away. The palanquin-blessed cut on his hand burned and throbbed as he ran away. When he got far enough away, he dropped dead.

Kyle Rhett, Woodcutter. Followed Heathcliff Gangwish when they made a break for it, then spooked Winston Jones when he returned to camp. Winston let a sling stone loose, which then left a gory dent in Kyle's skull. It was later found that the stone that killed Kyle was his favorite weird rock, which had gone missing.

Winston Jones, Professional Beggar. Refused to give up his sling to Turnip Nose, the guard. Winston was run through with Turnip Nose's short sword after he splintered a crutch battering at him.


Alaina Mark, Fugitive. Grabbed by a reddish sludge creature and partially dissolved before being completely dissolved by it. Managed to force another guard to join them in death.

Other Deceased

The Unknown Guard. What was his name? No one knows, and now he's part of a dead red blob.

A red blob.

Vyncent's horse.
