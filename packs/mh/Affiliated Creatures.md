# Mama's Incarnated

## Mama's Fleas

Mama gnaws at herself as her own infestation of horrid white fleas, possibly
representing her guilt over eating all those kids. The fleas have tiny human
faces. There are always fleas to spare.

Anyone within a few feet of Mama, her personal effects, or her Hut may find
themselves temporarily infested. (DC 5 Luck check; negative Luck modifiers
automatically fail.) Itching, welts, hunger arrive within minutes, lasting 1d4
hours. Take 1 point of Stamina damage each hour you do not consume a meal. The
fleas will succumb to any treatment that would affect normal fleas.

Mama may choose to purposely infest mammalian humanoids, which is much more
troubling. She may do this at will to creatures within her Hut, or as an attack.
(Fort DC of attack roll instead of damage.) This infestation establishes a link
between Mama and the infested.

- The fleas are no longer affected by mundane treatments. They can phase through
  the skin of the infected.
- Every spell cast by the infested burns an extra point of Stamina, which is
  transferred to Mama. This heals Mama by 10.
- Mama Hungry will arrive within 1d6 hours if invoked by the infested.
- Actions contrary to Mama Hungry's wishes at the most recent contact with her
  cause the fleas to become excited, causing itching, hunger, and pain. Lose 1d4
  hp/hour until at half maximum hp. Triple food requirements.
- Actually attacking Mama Hungry causes the fleas to attack internal organs.
  This does 1d1/round, increasing +D each round, and calling for a DC 5 Fort
  save. Failing this save causes instant death.

## Mama's Babies

Mama Hungry bakes all day, and sometimes she doesn't have time to eat everything
before it goes bad. Food that is neglected until it has aged beyond eating can
turn into one of Mama's Babies.

Baguettes barnacled with rot. Lopsided cupcakes fuzzed with orange mold. Half of
last month's turkey carcass. These things can become Mama's Babies. They hobble
around silently like dolls made of old food, usually with the wettest parts
forming big, sad eyes.

They usually stay out of sight. Occasionally a Baby (often a new one) will try
to ingratiate itself with Mama but attempting to help her with chores.

If killed, they fall apart into spoiled food and turn almost immediately into a
stinking black paste.
