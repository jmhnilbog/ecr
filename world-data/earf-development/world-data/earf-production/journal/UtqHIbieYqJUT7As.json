The minimum amount of Luck required for success is taken. If the roll would have succeeded anyway, 1 point of Luck is taken.</p>\n<p>A character that reaches 0 Luck in this manner is killed in a very unlikely way.</p>\n<p>A character may choose to Test Their Luck whenever they face a binary decision. This costs 1 Luck. The Judge makes a secret Luck check for the character and they make the most appropriate choice based on the success of the check.</p>\n</div>\n\n</div>",
