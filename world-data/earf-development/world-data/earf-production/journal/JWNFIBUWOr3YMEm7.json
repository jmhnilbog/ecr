Murder holes, fashioned in the likeness\nof looming toads, threaten to gout forth flaming oil and tar.\nBlack arrow slits pierce the high stone walls. You can hear the flap\nof the heretical banner above, hidden from sight by the vine-draped\nbattlements.\nThe ancient drawbridge has long since fallen away into ruin, leaving\nonly a few rotting planks placed across the ditch. The heavy iron\nportcullis stands half-raised, the rusty spikes a mere four feet above\nslots cut into the stone floor.\nPage 6\nTwo snarling beastmen lurk on the second floor of the gatehouse\n(accessible only from area H). Cautious PCs pausing to\nlisten will hear animal-like sniffing sounds and the scratch of\nclaws on stone coming from above.\nThe beastmen wait for the PCs to enter, then drop the portcullis\non the last rank (Atk portcullis -5 melee; Dmg 1d6/round).\nA hero pinned by the portcullis takes ongoing damage each\nround until he dies or is freed (DC 23 Str check; alternately, 4\ncharacters lifting together can hoist the portcullis if their combined\nStr exceeds 40).\nAfter dropping the portcullis, the beastmen toll a great bell.\nThis alerts their brothers to the PCsâ€™ presence. Their work\ndone, the howling beastmen withdraw to area H.</p>\n\n</div>",
