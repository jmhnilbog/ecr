	"content": "The courtyard is overgrown with sickly\nweeds and thick brambles. A deathly silence hangs in the air, as if\neven the frogs and insects are afraid to draw attention to themselves.\nThe smell of rotting vegetation is pervasive, and the ground sucks at\nyour boots with every tentative step.\nNearly all of the courtyard’s buildings have fallen into ruin. A single\nburnt-out shell set against the keep’s east wall is the only remaining\nstructure. Set near the heart of the courtyard is a well, framed with\na crude pulley system. To the east is the keep’s sole standing tower.\nHeroes pausing to inspect the ground easily discover a muddy\ntrail leading from the gatehouse through the brambles to the\nsouth tower (area H). The small side trail runs to the well (area\nF).\nThe muddy prints indicate a wide variety of creatures: human\nfootprints, the tracks of large creatures with only three toes,\nhawk-like talons, and perhaps even the slithering trail of an\nenormous snake. While seeming to hint at a variety of monsters,\nall the tracks belong to mutated beastmen.",
