No effects specific to sunlight can be mimicked by playing footsie with UV lamps or other foolishness.\n\n: Reflected sunlight is still sunlight, though it becomes weaker as it reflects and diffuses. Polished reflective surfaces work best to redirect sunlight.\n\nUnlight\n: Unlight is manufactured by truncating sunlight. It may counter sunlight.\n\n:::",
