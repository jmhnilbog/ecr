The minimum amount of Luck required for success is taken. If the roll would have succeeded anyway, 1 point of Luck is taken.\n\nA character that reaches 0 Luck in this manner is killed in a very unlikely way.\n\nA character may choose to Test Their Luck whenever they face a binary decision. This costs 1 Luck. The Judge makes a secret Luck check for the character and they make the most appropriate choice based on the success of the check.\n\n:::",
