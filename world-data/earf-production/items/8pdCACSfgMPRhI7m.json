			"notes": "This sword contains an evil entity from elsewhere that revels in destruction.\n\nThe sword must be Mastered by a new wielder before they may use it, and again if it put aside for any length of time. An attempt to wield the sword before this does [[/r 1d10]] damage.\n\nMastery requires a DC 15 PER check or [[/r 1d3]] PER damage.\n\nA fumbled Mastery check gives control of the wielder to the sword. Should the wielder ever have 3 or fewer PER, the sword likewise gains control. It remains in control until the wielder is slain or disarmed.\n\nAdditional attempts at Mastery compel additional powers from the sword:\n- DC 20 PER or [[/r 1d5]] PER damage allows one of these benefits:\n\t- applies +1 to hit and damage for 1 battle\n\t- casts @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-journals.Magic Shield] at [[/r 1d20]] spell check\n\t- grants +3 to a single saving throw\n- DC 25 PER or [[/r 2d5]] PER damage allows one of these benefits:\n\t- applies +3 to hit and damage for 1 battle\n\t- casts @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-journals.Magic Missile] at [[/r 1d24]] spell check\n\t- turn a critical hit into a miss\n- DC 30 PER or [[/r 3d5]] PER damage allows one of these benefits:\n\t- applies +5 to hit and damage for 1 battle\n\t- casts @Compendium[dcc-core-book.dcc-core-spell-journals.Dispel Magic] at [[/r 1d30]] spell check\n\t- heal wielder by [[/r 1d5]] hit dice\n\nThe wielder may use the sword to heal PER damage by causing havoc and ruin. Each sentient killed by the wielder heals 1 PER point; more terrible deeds give more aid.\n\nThe sword may communicate telepathically within 20'.\n\nChaotic wielders cause the sword to blaze with blue-green flame adding [[/r 1d3]] damage to each hit.\n\nThe sword may hit magical, ethereal, and astral creatures."
