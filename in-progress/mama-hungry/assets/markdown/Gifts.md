## Equipment

### Armor

- Reliquary Armor. well-made horse-leather armor with a small internal pocket in front of the heart. As long as a lawful religious item is present within the pocket, it acts as Leather +1 for lawful characters. (-1 for chaotic characters.) An actual Lawful relic planed in the pocket gives additional protection.

### Spells

Spells given to non-spellcasters use 1d14 instead of 1d20. They may use another stat to base casting off of.

- Burning Spit: burning sputum! Caster bites a brick, stone, or other hard object as part of the casting; the success of the magic protects the caster from this. On a failed casting, this does 1d4 spellburn damage to the jaw and teeth. The caster then spits the broken pieces at the target. See Magic Missile for corruption.

The Judge is encouraged to apply special effects depending on the type of 'hard object' used as part of the casting.

1: Lost, failure, worse.
2: Lost, failure, a bloody mouth.

20: Range 30'. May target an area (radius 20') and spit there, causing 1d4 damage to targets in the area, igniting opponents on DC Reflex save. The hazard remains for 1d4 rounds.
24: Range 60'. Burns up to three targets for a total of up to 3d4, igniting opponents on DC Reflex save. (Or may target area as above.)

28+: The caster may choose to swallow the chunks instead of spitting them. This allows the caster to vomit forth the flaming debris in a cone 60' x 20', doing 4d4 damage and knocking victims prone.
