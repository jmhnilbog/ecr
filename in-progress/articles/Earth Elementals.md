# Some Notable Earth Elementals of Earf

Few Elementals have names or what could be thought of as identities, let alone personalities. Those that do pose unique challenges and opportunities for summoners.

## Gravesoil

### Appearance

A monolithic form, tall as an ogre, composed of hundreds of stone humanoid arms and hands. Some are rough-hewn, some appear to be snatched from statuary. Gravesoil uses sets of hands to form a rough “face” when compelled to communicate. Pleased, it smells a bit like wet prunes. Otherwise, corruption.

### Origin

The creatures of the Linear Hills performed the first known summoning of Gravesoil, within the bounds of the Long Grave.

### On the Elemental Planes

Gravesoil ‘plays dead’ and angrily opposes any attempts at interaction that refute this subterfuge.

### Manifestation

The earth rumbles briefly before the many hands claw themselves out of the ground, raising its body like a fountain. Stone slabs and icons of remembrance spill from it as Gravesoil manifests, from distant cemeteries.

### Attitude

Gravesoil considers life wasted on the living and prefers the company of the undead, un-dead, un/dead, and dead. Summoned and compelled to work by a living magus, it constantly complains, bargains, and grumbles. It is much less alien in outlook than most elementals, due to long communication with the sentient dead. Gravesoil chooses to interpret each summoning as a ‘resurrection’ and each dismissal as a ‘death’.

### Special Traits

PRINCELY
: Gravesoil is nearly as powerful as an elemental prince.

SPEAKS WITH DEAD
: Gravesoil may communicate with the dead interred in a graveyard in which it is summoned. Supplied with additional information, Gravesoil may communicate with any sentient, interred, dead creature.

CIVILIZED
: Ghoulish invocations of Gravesoil are common and complex. At least one ghoulish society sees Gravesoil as a sort of broker between the eaters of the dead and the souls of the eaten, offering up strange payments to it at intervals.

MOURNED
: When dismissed, Gravesoil expects a show of mourning at its departure. It is likely to return, angrily, if no such memorial is performed.

HOOK-SOURCE
: The funereal accoutrements littered about Gravesoil when it manifests sometimes hold information related to its summoners, such as grave-markers of distant family, scraps of last wills & testaments, or items interred with personages known to them.

## Now-Many-Places

### Appearance

A ‘blank’, featureless humanoid composed of precious, non-terrene metals and gemstones. Psychic contact with the creature allows very limited communication, primarily of great distances and huge pressures.

### Origin

Now-Many-Places was first summoned by the dwarves of the Over-Underworld, who sought new materials with which to fashion items. The elemental consciousness took hold of a small asteroid and directed it, explosively, to Earf. Now-Many-Places’ consciousness scattered in the explosion and remains so, becoming diffuse on the elemental plane as well.

### On the Elemental Planes

Occasional ‘successful’ psychic contact with Now-Many-Places has been reported near small nodes of outré materials, but it does not appear to exist in a meaningful way there.

### Manifestation

It takes 8-64 hours for Now-Many-Places to manifest, slowly forming a cyst under the place of summoning. During this time, the minuscule traces of the (high valuable) materials required to shape its physical form are dragged from distant places. The manifestation fails, explosively (as described below, though reduced in potency), if force shields or similar efforts are deployed to ‘intercept’ these materials. Any outside attempt to breach or move the cyst causes it to crumble to ash. When ready, the cyst breaches the surface and hatches like an infinitely thin-shelled egg, revealing Now-Many-Places in fetal position. It then rapidly heats up and explodes unless killed or banished within 10-100 seconds, enacting a strange kind of passion play. It may only manifest where it may see the sky.

It has been used as either a motherlode of raw material or a living bomb many times, but reprisals from space tend to eliminate its summonners.

### Attitude

Now-Many-Places is strange and violent. Unmolested, it behaves unpredictably, as if under the effects of confusion. Any threat is immediately met with violence.

### Special Traits

EXPLOSION
: Now-Many-Places explodes 10-100 seconds after manifestation, becoming scattered once again. This explosion takes place partly within Now-Many-Places’ own thoughts and partly within the Elemental plane of Earth, so it is much less devastating than the asteroidal impact that accompanied its creation. Even so, all within 60’ is annihilated and that within 360’ is disintegrated. The landscape is blasted within a mile, destroying most features and buildings (6d6 damage). Creatures in this range take 10d6 damage. Hard cover halves this damage; sections of buildings and features that retain half hp provide hard cover to those behind them. Any creatures in psychic contact with Now-Many-Places at the moment it explodes take 10d6 damage.

FRAGILE
: Sudden changes in temperature caused to Now-Many-Places (such as those caused by cold magic or large quantities of water) may cause immediate explosion. (Save vs. Fortitude.)

FRICTIVE
: As soon as it ‘hatches’ from its enclosing cyst, Now-Many-Places rapidly increases in temperature and sheds mass until it explodes, in memory of its initial journey through the atmosphere. Every 10 seconds, its body and a 5’ radius around it increase in temperature by 100 degrees Fahrenheit. This heat radiates outward with time. (Example: In the 5th round, it is +100 degrees 20’ from Now-Many-Places; +200 degrees 15’ away, +300 degrees 10’ away, and +400 degrees 5’ away.) Most creatures are forced to retreat within seconds, and most metals are softened within a few rounds. The value of any remains Now-Many-Places leaves is decreased by 1d10% each round.

TOXIC
: Inhaling the fumes the burning elemental gives off is also dangerous. Any creatures breathing it suffer long-term effects of exposure as determined by the GM should they fail a Save vs. Poison after the encounter.

OTHERWORLDLY SYMPATHY
: Attempts to 'mine' Now-Many-Places by repeated summoning and banishment are met with storms of 'sympathetic' meteor impacts targetting the sources of such summoning and banishment energy.

VALUABLE
: If killed or dismissed before exploding, the remains of Now-Many-Places are immensely valuable. They are composed of materials almost impossible to find otherwise, and can easily fetch the equivalent of two million gold pieces.


## Prince Crawl

### Appearance

An astoundingly huge annelid made of stone plates, covered in fibrous glass cilia. It is between 500' and a mile long.

### Origin

Prince Crawl awoke when the first, simple earthworm accidentally fell into the Elemental Planes. So fascinated with the creature and its wet movements was the Prince that it has never thought anything else but worm-thoughts or traveled other than worm-travel.

### On the Elemental Planes

Prince Crawl behaves as a huge earthworm. Non-native sentients visiting the Elemental Plane are often found living within or behind it, as its predicability offers protection against the stranger threats of the Plane.

### Manifestation

The worm-prince pushes its head from the earth and briefly pauses, mouth agape, before the summoner. The tunnel behind Prince Crawl extends for at least then full length of its body, though it mostly collapses after the Prince moves on.

### Attitude

Prince Crawl behaves much as an earthworm does. Few things can harm something the size of the worm-prince, but those that do cause it to thrash about wildly and forget the terms of summonning. It enjoys moving through earth as a worm moreso than it does as an elemental.

### Special Traits:

ASTOUNDINGLY HUGE
: Prince Crawl is hugely strong and and nearly tireless, though nearly brainless.

FRIEND TO FARMERS
: Prince Crawl may be directed to aerate and improve enormous areas of farmland if directed to do so. It performs this task as a side effect of its normal existance on Earf as it wanders randomly. This creates tunnels that partially collapse behind it.

GREAT SPEED
: A summoner may choose to enter the gut of Prince Crawl with allies and equipment, and direct it to travel to a location on Earf or the Elemental Plane by phasing through stone and earth instead of its preferred total mimicry of an earthworm. The Prince's ability to phase through earth is extended to those within it.

  Prince Crawl has nearly no friction against soil and stone when phasing, and uses its cilia to augment its speed. This causes constant acceleration of 30' a round until...very, very fast.

  Summoners wishing to travel at very fast speeds or for very long distances must provide their own air and protection from any substances that the Prince encounters. (The Prince can phase through cooling magma, but the heat would still cook most creatures; pockets of water or chunks of worked stone it encountered would hit creatures within it with great force.)

LIVING RAIL GUN
: Prince Crawl can attain such incredible speeds, has such amazing bulk, and is so happily stupid that it may be used as a missile. It may arc out of the ground or from the side of a mountain through the air at a target or be aimed straight into the underside of a city or any side of an undercity. This does damage as adjucated by the GM and causes banishment of Prince Crawl for at least 100 years from the entire civilization of its summonners. Crop yields are greatly decreased for the duration.

CONTROLLED
: Prince Crawl is so useful as an aid to travel that it is often kept summoned and bound by groups who may then charge fees for its use. It is not known if the prince would resent this if it knew of its 'exploitation'. This binding also prevents the prince's use as a massive living weapon; it is not known if the prince cares about this, either.
