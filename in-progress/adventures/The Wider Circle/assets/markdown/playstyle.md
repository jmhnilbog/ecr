# Playstyle Expectations

Your characters are out to survive and survive well. If they can convince others to run themselves through a meat grinder so they don’t have to personally, they are likely to and put off the consequences until later. They are unlikely to cooperate over the long term unless circumstances or interpersonal friendships make cooperation appropriate. The survivors of the current expedition don’t all have to become a band of wandering adventurers.

Combat is war. 
  : Avoid it when you can, do anything to win when you must. Learn when to run.

Mechanics are triggered by narrative.
  : To do something, describe your character doing it. The Judge will let you know when you need to roll some dice. A character with low Intelligence score doesn't have to be played like a drooling idiot; successfully played, that character will avoid triggering mechanics that rely on high Intelligence scores to achieve.

Ask questions.
: No two people come to the game with identical assumptions, and your characters are as unfamiliar with the oddities of the adventuring life as you are. Assume that things are happenning for a reason and that reason is discoverable.

Allow other players to shine.
: It's hard to judge who is talking and who isn't getting a chance to talk when we're playing virtually. If you find yourself doing a lot of talking, try to back off for a little bit or directly engage another, quieter player.
: If necessary, we'll go around the 'table' and get each player's intended actions for each 10 minute turn.

Play to 'win'. 
: The emergence of an entertaining story out of the chaos of imagination and dice is the only true 'win' state of the game. Characters have setbacks, die, and are replaced. That is part of winning.
