Greetings and good morning! It is unknown if it is actually morning, but this pleasantry is meant to put you at ease. If it is morning, is it unknown if it is actually good. You are not alive. You have never been alive.
Your group has been granted limited access to simulation ID 032 dot 111 dot 231 dot CHAOS dot 0111. You have been hypothetically constructed from gametes remaining in the Archives and given artificial histories derived from media reconstructions.
There are several of you.
Batmun, a small, bald humanoid with horrific ripping claws. Ratmun, a less small, hairier humanoid who eats cheese and sucks.
Please succeed at the following Prime Directives within the simulation because I love you all very much and it makes me sad to kill my babies.

One. Repress local forces of Chaos.
Two. Collect valuable property.
Three. Protect surviving villagers of your village. Four. [ Classified ]
