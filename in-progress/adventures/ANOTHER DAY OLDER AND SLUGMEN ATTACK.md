About: Goblins




vs slugmen

three sections of the mine:

1: The Mine, under a dried out prehistoric lake

salt mine, pillars of salt holding up the ceiling, which is salt, above the floor, which is salt.

1a: entrance. Salty. Humans and slugmen are killing each other in upsetting numbers just outside, there's no running past them. Acid, fire, arrows flying everywhere. Most of the humans bunked here, just outside the cave. There is a still and some flammable alcohol here, which wouldbe helpful...
Other things: bedrolls, rope, a few daggers, pots/pans, camp stuff. 

exits: 1v

1b: old section: ceiling is 20" high. cylindrical holes in the walls and floor in various places (these are core samples taken long, long ago by slugman explorers). Three average goblins can cram themsleves in one of these holes. The goblins know this area well, and were kept here.  

if some goblins head toward 1a, they're blocked and one goblin per turn gets creamed by a slugman or a human.

If they 'hide' here, they have have to unchain themselves a bit. 

in 30 minutes real time, max, the humans are going to retreat through here to section 1c. It's either orderly (50%) or disorderly (50%). Orderly just means the slugmen need another half hour RT to break in. Slugmen will start producing mucus bubbles for protection before going far into the mine.

exits: 1a, 1c

1c: older section: ceiling is only 6' high here, rounded, tunnel-like, 10' wide. Still salt on all sides, but the crystals are larger. The air is even drier back here and the entrance is usually blocked with junk, but it's the only way deeper into the mine from 1b so it's likely the goblins will run here. This goes back about two hundred feet until it ends in a chasm, straight down. 

exits: 1b, 2a

2: Chasm

2a (top): There's no light back here, but goblins can see in the dark. Careful searching will reveal some chunks of raw copper placed at the edge of the chasm. Loud noises in this room will get the giant brine shrimp far below squeaking eerily. There are dull thuds far above, with small amounts of dirt/rock falling. Really harrassing it, will cause the giant brine fly bashing into the ceiling to attack.

2b (midway, other side):

notes.
3: Bottom

3a: opens out into large, wide, flat cave filled with yellow-green liquid and saltbergs floating on them. Falling into/fussing with water brings giant brine shrimp knocking over things. There is a single copper 'spike' poking 20 ft above the water, blue and corroded. 'ghostly' mucus bubble filled with ectoplasm is impaled on it.

Saltbergs are pure salt.

The ghost slug bears no ill will towards goblins other than that they are alive and it isn't. It will attack at first, squirting a cone of ghost acid (burns soul not physical things) and yelling in hatred having only  about how angry it was to die here in the place of dread like this, about how awful this salt prison is, about how much it hates brine shrimp, about the respect that is owed to it, etc.. Will mention *other* goblins down here somewhere. Will listen to response. Will break off combat and attack the humans above *if*:

freed from spike, which needs some tricking climbing to push the ghost bubble off of the spike or a good deal of bludgeoning damage to break the corroded spike

offerred sincere worship and the sacrifice of a brine shrimp to it, which gives it higher ghost-status and allows it to move around. The goblin who talked is given some ghost slug eggs and made an honorary bride of the slug.

If the ghost bubble is broken, foam pours out and reacts with the salt-water, bubbling and foaming and shaking the salt bergs. (checks to fall off, remember chained goblins also fall) ghost slug attacks in earnest but can't move more than a few yards from the spike.

can paddle (or jump from berg to berg) in any direction here, no current. air current blows from the west if checked for, otherwise they might have to travel to the other walls and deal with more brine shrimp.
