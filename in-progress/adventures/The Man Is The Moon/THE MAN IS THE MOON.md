The Tomb of The organon magISTeroS By Tim CallahanBackgroundDuring the Last War, the ancients deployed their war-skiff assault units from elevator platforms that now dot a sector of the wasteland like a ravaged forest of rusted steel stumps. Most of the platforms are bur-ied by the shifting sands or stand as shattered reminders of a war that was once meaningful, but one of these decaying steel stumps still remains partially energized, layered with tunnels below ground, and powered by a unique extra-di-mensional reactor core beneath the surface of the planet.Recently, the control center of this still pulsating war-skiff platform has become the hive for a tribe of half-man/half-beetle humanoids known as trillimites. They have discov-ered the strange potency of the energies deep underground and they have begun to breed at a hyper-active rate.Tapping into the power of the strange reactor, the trillimite larvae now grow at an accelerated speed and their frenzied need for sustenance has triggered a kind of pheromone-drenched hypersonic beacon that lures prey to them, so they may feed their ferocious hunger.The PCs will likely be drawn to the trillimite hive, because to ignore the hypersonic beacon causes them pain (and In-telligence loss), but the hive is a deadly blend of ancient technologies gone awry, trillimite guardians, and a frenzied larvae swarm that wants nothing more than to devour any-thing that enters the central nest. If the PCs find and disable the reactor core, the larvae swarm will no longer torment them with its hypersonic wails, but there’s a catch: the re-actor core is a living tomb for the Organon Magisteros, an extradimensional sentient being of pure geometry who was summoned by the ancient masters and used, against its will, to power this unique reactor.The destruction of the reactor core or substantial damage to its control panel will free the Organon Magisteros and un-leash a force wave of matter reconstruction as it departs from this plane of existence, leaving the PCs possibly trapped in a tomb all their own, with newly-mechanized hybrid tril-limites seeking revenge in the depths of their former hive.Judge’s noTesThe trillimite larvae beacon lures the PCs to the hive by constantly inducing pain and Intelligence loss until the PCs move toward the hive. The judge should determine the outer range of the beacon and when it begins to impact the characters, but once the PCs begin to succumb to the penal-ties of the hypersonic beacon, they each lose 1 hit point and 1 point of Intelligence per hour until they progress directly toward the vibrating steel stump in the distance. The effect should manifest as a faint, but shrill, hum and an inability for the PCs to sustain concentration; hit point and Intel-ligence loss cease as the PCs head directly toward the loca-tion of the trillimite hive, and the PCs regain any hit points or intelligence points as soon as they spend at least 1 turn in the underground war-skiff deployment center beneath the steel stump, or if the trillimite larvae hive is destroyed or rendered silent. Once the PCs are within closer range of the hive, the pen-alties for turning away increase: if the party is within 100 feet of the hive and they move away from it for more than 1 turn, or make no progress toward entering the vibrating steel stump and climbing down into the tunnels below, each character takes 1 hp of psychic damage per round and also loses 1d3 Intelligence points per round. Again, the hit points and Intelligence points will cease if they continue to progress underground toward the hive or toward the reac-tor core, and the hit points and Intelligence points will be restored if the PCs spend at least 1 turn in the trillimite hive or destroy or silence the larvae.The steel stump and the trillimite hive are both places fraught with danger. For each turn spent exploring any of the areas in and around those locations prior to the deactivation of the reactor core or the release of the Organon Magisteros, the judge should roll a d8 to determine if a random encounter occurs, and, if a 1 or 2 is rolled, roll a d6 to determine the type of encounter on Table 1-1 below: (For random encounters af-ter the deactivation of the reactor core, or the release of the Organon Magisteros, see Table 1-4 on page 24.)Table 1-1: Random Encounters (1d6)1 Defective war-skiff engine. A sleek metal cylin-der embedded within a corroded frame begins to crackle and shake, revealing a sliver of greenstone shard as a power supply. Anyone or anything mak-ing contact with the cylinder or the shard will trig-ger a small explosion, dealing 1d10 damage to ev-eryone within 20’ of the cylinder, unless they make a DC 20 Reflex save. After the explosion, a single greenstone shard is recoverable to any one charac-ter who makes a successful Luck check.2 1d3 Trillimite Outcasts: Init +2; Atk tarsal claw +2 melee (1d4) or barbed chains +2 (1d8) or special; AC 14; HD 2d8; hp 14 each; MV 40’; Act 1d20; SP cannot be surprised by normal means, wall-crawl-ing, pheromone blast 20’ radius once per turn – all living creatures in range must succeed on a DC 20 Will save or become confused and attack a random target in the area; SV Fort +5, Ref +2, Will +4; AL L.3 Energy field malfunction. Ancient wiring running beneath the ground has decayed and begun to cre-ate an energy feedback loop in what used to be a component of a force field generator. The energy field is visible as an arc of crackling electric energy, and it strikes all targets within 30’ wearing metal ar-
Page 19mor (or, if no metal armor is worn, the closest target within range holding a metal weapon) at +8 to hit, dealing 1d12 damage. The arc of electric energy con-tinues to strike metal-laden targets until they move outside of the 30’ range or throw water or another form of liquid on the ground to short out the wiring.4 1 Spined Trillimite: Init +2; Atk rusted sword +3 (1d8); AC 16; HD 2d8; hp 16; MV 40’; Act 1d20; SP cannot be surprised by normal means, wall-crawl-ing, any successful attacks against this trillimite deals damage, but any melee attacker must suc-ceed on a DC 15 Reflex save or take 1d8 damage from the sharp spines and then succeed on a DC 12 Fortitude save or take an additional 1d6 poison damage; SV Fort +5, Ref +2, Will +1; AL L. 5 1d4 Trillimite Guardians: Init +2; Atk tarsal claw +2 melee (1d4) or spear +3 (1d6); AC 18; HD 2d8; hp 10 each; MV 40’; Act 1d20; SP cannot be surprised by normal means, wall-crawling, on any successful melee attack against Trillimite Guardian damage is dealt as normal but non-magical weapons shatter unless attacker succeeds on a Luck check; SV Fort +5, Ref +2, Will +1; AL L.6 Telepathic Contact by the Organon Magisteros. All PCs are contacted by the entombed being of pure geometry. Lawful characters will get a brief glimpse of the reactor core and a vision of lifting the metallic sphere out of the reactor stabilization fluid. Neutral characters will get a brief glimpse from inside a sphere—the orb glows blue and yel-low and fills them with warmth. Chaotic characters will get a glimpse of an explosion of blue light in-side the reactor core and new tunnels opening up underground as the bedrock tears open.Encounter TableArea Type Encounter1-1 C Trillimite guardians (6)2-1 T Waste disposal unit2-2 C Trillimite outcasts (4)2-3 P/C Bypassing electrified wires, prisoners (3)3-1 C Trillimite acid spitters (8)Sentient bacteria tendrils (3)4-1 T Feeding frenzy in the larvae nest4-2 C Trillimite overlord, egg-mothers (3)4-3 P Deactivating reactor via the control room5-1 P/T Freeing Organon Magisteros from reactorPLayer sTarTThe sands of the wastes are speckled with shimmering gems and rusted fragments of twisted metal. The shrill hum that has been so distractingly painful seems to emanate from a large vibrat-ing reddish gray stump in the distance. As you move toward it, though the hum continues, the pain lessens.The “shimmering gems” are small fragments of shattered glass, caused by the intense heat of the ancient war-skiff battles and the utter devastation of the Last War. The glass fragments are essentially worthless as trade items. The twisted metal represents pieces of war-skiff platforms, now in ruins. Only one platform remains, and that is the reddish gray stump, vibrating like a tuning fork from the trillimite larvae beacon below.Area 1-1 – Steel Stump/War-skiff Platform: The con-cave rusted steel walls rise twenty feet into the air around this vibrating circular structure. The arched doorway is piled to the top with metal plates and stones, blocking any clear passage as they shake from the vibrating hum echoing through this edifice.There is no roof on this structure, and a party may attempt to gain entrance a number of ways, including climbing over the walls or pulling the blockage out of the doorway. Six trillimite guardians stand ready inside the steel stump, ex-pecting more victims to be lured toward the hive below by the subsonic beacon of the larvae, which has been magni-fied by the strange acoustics of this still-standing structure. The vibrating walls are unpleasant for the trillimite guard-ians, though they will climb up to position themselves to pounce down on any party that shifts the blockage from the archway and enters via that passage. If a party climbs over the walls, two trillimite guardians will stand their ground inside the steel stump while the remaining four will at-tempt to close in on the intruders by climbing along the walls on either side.The interior of the steel stump is almost completely clean of ancient machinery and the remnants of the war-skiff elevator platform have been torn away long ago, leaving just a hint of what was once here via the gouges in the wall where the platform would have been tracked for upward movement. In the floor of the steel stump, a maw door lays partially open, leading to a ladder descending into level 2 below.This maw door, circular, with metal “teeth” that open and close, is disabled, leaving just a hint of its potential danger in the form of jutting blades of metal that line its perimeter. Unless precautions are declared, all PCs must make a Luck check when climbing down through this maw door to the ladder below. Failure results in the character taking 1 hp of damage from the sharp edges of the not-fully-open maw. The ladder downward is illuminated by thin glowing yel-low strips along its edges, faintly powered by the still op-erational reactor in Area 5-1.Trillimite Guardians (6): Init +2; Atk tarsal claw +2 melee (1d4) or spear +3 (1d6); AC 18; HD 2d8; hp 12 each; MV 40’ or special; Act 1d20; SP cannot be surprised by normal means, wall-crawling, on any successfully melee attack against a trillimite guardian damage is dealt as normal but non-magical weapons shatter unless attacker succeeds on a Luck check; SV Fort +5, Ref +2, Will +1; AL L.A Note about Levels 2 through 5: All areas on these lev-els are lit with thin glowing yellow strips along the ceiling, and these provide sufficient, but dim, light, unless the reac-tor core shuts down. The maw doors leading to each room on level 2 are closed and locked. They can be each be pried open with a DC 20 Strength check, disabled with a DC 22
Page 20lockpicking check, or destroyed if dealt 30 points of dam-age or more (the trillimites come and go by easily prying the doors open with their multiple tarsal limbs). If pried open, the blades will hold in place temporarily, but unless the door is wedged open by something made of steel or sturdier, the blades have a chance of slamming shut on any character passing through the open door. Each character who walks or crawls through a pried-open maw door must roll a Luck check. Failure results in the blades closing on the victim, dealing 1d12 damage immediately, and an additional 1d6 damage each round until the victim is freed from the closed maw door by opening it again or destroying the teeth.Area 2-1 – Trillimite Guardian Nest: Sickly greenish goo sticks to the walls, and other than piles of rags in each corner of this white room, the only notable feature is the pillar near the cen-ter of the far wall. The pillar seems unable to support any weight, with its midsection completely missing.This is the sleeping area for the trillimite guardians, who normally rotate their watches with four guardians in area 1-1 and two guardians sleeping at all times, but with the in-creased feeding frenzy of the larvae, all six guardians have remained on watch for three days straight, and they have not used this room during that time.The pillar with the midsection missing is a remnant of ancient technology – a kind of waste disposal unit that disintegrates anything placed in its opening. Powered by the reactor in area 5-1, this unit lacks any kind of markings to indicate any way to turn it on or off. To use it, someone must simply place an object (organic or inorganic) into the opening, and with-in one second, beams of brilliant blue light will flash from the top and bottom of the pillar, immediately disintegrating what was placed inside. If a PC places his hand or any other body part inside the opening, a DC 20 Reflex save is needed or that body part disappears forever, though the PC takes only 1d3 damage, since any wound is immediately cauter-ized. The judge may determine additional penalties.The greenish goo on the walls is trillimite saliva used to mark their territory and is utterly harmless.Area 2-2 – Trillimite Outcast Area/Prison Guards: Four men with multiple insectoid legs glare out from the door-way for an instant before grabbing spiked chains off the floor and charging directly toward you.Subtle mutations have turned a small group of trillimites into outcasts from the main nest and they have currently been redeployed by the trillimite overlord to serve on pris-on duty, protecting some of the recent victims who have been lured to the nest by the larvae beacon. This is fresh meat, maintained in area 2-3 for the next larvae feeding time, the outcasts’ most important job has been making sure the trillimite guardians haven’t tried to steal away any of the prisoners for their own meals. But the outcasts im-mediately recognize the PCs as potential threats to the hive, and a captive party to be used to feed the larvae would please the trillimite overlord. Unconscious PCs will be im-mediately chained up and brought into area 2-3 once any fighting has ended. Dead PCs would be brought into that area also, awaiting orders for the next round of feeding.This room was once the heart of the control room for war-skiff deployment, metal panels and blackened rectangles of glass line the walls, one on each side marked by the eight ancient runes that can be used to activate this information center, though many of the runes are splattered with green goo from the trillimites. The PCs would not be able to acti-vate the terminals in any meaningful way to control any part of the underground area from here due to the damage to the infrastructure over the years. But if they seek information, a PC who activates Rune 8 then immediately activates Rune 1 before touching anything else can discover the basic layout of the tunnels, the location of the reactor core and the reac-tor control room, and the blackened rectangles of glass will provide brief glimpses of each room in Levels 2-5. Any PC who touches any of the runes in this area, whether successful at activating the information center or not, will trigger telepathic contact for the whole party by the Orga-non Magisteros. He will embed the following image in the characters’ mind (read aloud to all players): You go blind for an instant, then see a series of geometric shapes – a sphere trans-forming into a cube, then a pyramid then a shape that you can’t quite understand, and it fills your field of vision – pulsating with light and soothing calmness. You feel connected to something greater than yourself, but you also feel that whatever is reaching out to you needs your help. The final vision you see in your mind is a horizon line with an inverted pyramid pointing downward. A rainbow arcs along the left-side of that pyramid, then pulses with blue light before the images disappear. Trillimite Outcasts (4): Init +2; Atk tarsal claw +2 melee (1d4) or barbed chains +2 (1d8) or special; AC 14; HD 2d8; hp 14 each; MV 40’ or special; Act 1d20; SP cannot be sur-prised by normal means, wall-crawling, pheromone blast 20’ radius once per turn – all living creatures in range must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or become confused and at-tack a random target in the area; SV Fort +5, Ref +2, Will +4; AL L.Note that the outcasts’ pheromone blast also affects them-selves, and yet they will use it as their first response to any stressful situation, which is why they have been pushed away from the central hive area.Area 2-3 – Trillimite Prison Area/Food Supply: Three strange creatures wriggle inside metal nets that crackle with energy. One vulture-like reptile, one white-skinned humanoid with a missing arm, and a shaggy boar with protruding tusks, all trapped and clearly suffering.This room was once a control annex and war-skiff work-shop, but now this makeshift prison area has been repur-posed by the trillimites as a food storage room. The metal nets holding the prisoners are barbed chains lined with an-cient hard-wired circuits pulled from the walls. The nets pulsate with electric power coming from the reactor core, keeping the prisoners paralyzed, though they still kick with an occasional involuntary spasm. The wires of the net-ting crisscross the room, making it impossible to traverse the room and avoid contact with the nets unless a DC 20 Agility check is made.Any contact by the PCs with the circuitry netting will deal electricity 1d8 damage to each prisoner and to the PC who
Page 21
Page 22touched the net (with a body part or with a metal object). The only way to disable the electrified net is to turn off power to the complex by disabling the reactor core or by smashing the source of the wiring – the metal wall panels in this room – by dealing 20 points of damage to each side. If the 20 points is dealt, the PC dealing the final blow to a wall panel must make a DC 20 Reflex save or become blinded for 1d6 turns by the flare-out, unless precautions are taken.If the PCs free the prisoners, intentionally or unintention-ally, the gribb and kith will try to escape to the surface and attack anything standing in their way, while the tusk terror will accompany the party for the rest of their time on the Purple Planet and attack any obvious enemies, becoming a loyal companion animal to the PC with the lowest Personal-ity score.A thorough search of the walls of this room will reveal a se-ries of drawers containing components for war-skiff manu-facture and a greenstone cache with 1d5 greenstone shards still intact.The far corner of this room also contains a ladder leading down to the reactor areas below. Prisoner #1 – Gribb: Init +2; Atk beak +3 melee (1d4) or talon +0 melee (1d6+2); AC 13; HD 1d10; hp 5; MV 50’ (fly); Act 1d20; SV Fort -1, Ref +2, Will +0; AL C.Prisoner #2 – One-Armed Kith: Init -2; Atk punch -1 melee (1d3) or improvised weapon +1 melee (varies); AC 10; HD 1d12+2; hp 8; MV 30’; Act 1d20; SV Fort +2, Ref -1, Will +1; AL Var.Prisoner #3 – Tusk Terror: Init +3; Atk adhesive spew +3 missile fire (special) or charge +6 melee (1d12 or special); AC 14; HD 8d6; hp 23; MV charge 60’; Act 1d20; SP tar-get immobilized by adhesive spew unless Ref save is made against the attack roll, charging gore after successful adhe-sive attack for +10 to hit, dealing 2d12 damage; SV Fort +5, Ref +2, Will +0; AL C.Area 3-1 – Trillimite Nest (Former Hydroponic Gar-den Walkway):Dripping vines of glowing reddish-brown reach aggressively from a murky rectangular pool toward a clus-ter of five-legged beetle men who defend themselves by spitting green globs of burning acid from their mouths. The humming sound has become increasingly louder.This former hydroponic garden has become stagnant as the water supply has not been properly maintained, and the bacteria carried into the room inadvertently by the trillimites has mixed with the radioactive energy remains inside the pool to become a hostile, sentient force, lashing out at any-thing nearby. The trillimite acid-spitters are the equivalent of soldier ants working to protect the hive, and as they cut down the tendrils from the water, new tendrils rise up. The southern edge of this area overlooks the nest in area 4-1, and the broken stairway leads downward towards the hyperactive buzzing of the frenzied trillimite larvae below.Sentient Bacteria Tendrils (3): Init +1; Atk toxic touch +4 melee (1d8); AC 10; HD 1d8 plus special; hp 4 each; MV special; Act 1d20; SP destroyed tendrils regenerate com-pletely in bacteria-laded water after 3 rounds unless water is treated with soap, alcohol, or a purification spell, tendrils cannot move out of the water, but can reach 30’ from the water; SV Fort +1, Ref +1, Will -1; AL N.Trillimite Acid-Spitters (8): Init +4; Atk tarsal claw +2 me-lee (1d4) or acid spit +2 missile fire (1d6); AC 14; HD 2d8; hp 11 each; MV 40’ or burrowing 30’; Act 1d20; SP cannot be surprised by normal means, wall-crawling, acid spit range 20’; SV Fort +5, Ref +2, Will +1; AL L.Area 4-1 – Larvae Hive: The stairway below leads to an arched vault of a room filled with nooks that seem to be writhing with greyish pink worms the size of small cats. The worms have teeth, and their screeching echoes off the metal walls in a deafening hum.Note, if the reactor has been de-powered previously, the “deafening hum” would be replaced with “muffled hum.”The damaged stairway is difficult and dangerous to climb, with loose metal slats and jagged edges. A character at-tempting to climb up or down the stairs in this area must make a DC 15 Agility check or fall prone to the ground and take 1d8 damage.If the 100 trillimite larvae are still frenzied (because the reactor is still operational, pumping irradiated fluids into the walls of the nest), then they will attack via the rules outlined below. Otherwise, a small group of them attack defensively as individual small creatures, while the rest re-main curled up and quivering.Frenzied Trillimite Larvae Swarm (special): Roll initiative for the Larvae Swarm at +5. Any PC in the Area – on the stairs or lower – will be attacked with a roll of 3d24 and sub-tracting the PC’s full armor class. If the result is a positive number, that character takes that many points of damage. If the result is zero or a negative number, that character takes no damage.The trillimite swarm has an effective AC of 15, and any suc-cessful attacks against the swarm reduce its attack by one die along the dice chain, regardless of the damage dealt. Thus a successful attack against the swarm would reduce the swarm to a 3d20 attack, while a second successful at-tack would reduce the swarm to a 3d16 attack, etc. If an opponent succeeds on an area attack, a magical effect, or a mighty deed which hits 2 or more targets, the Swarm at-tack is reduced by two dice, so 3d24 would immediately drop to 3d16 for the Swarm’s next attack. Note, when the swarm dice reach 3d3 and then take any additional dam-age beyond that, the swarm is considered destroyed as the remaining larvae curl up and play dead.If the swarm is not frenzied due to reactor shutdown, then 2d10 of them crawl from their resting areas and attack in-dividually:Regular Trillimite Larvae (2d10): Init +1; Atk bite +2 melee (1d4); AC 9; HD 1d8; hp 1 each; MV 20’; Act 1d20; SV Fort +1, Ref -1, Will -2; AL C.Area 4-2 – Trillimite Overlord: A bloated, grotesque beetle-man lies across several piled mattresses. He is attended to by three females with multiple insectoid legs that pull cabbage-sized tubers from beneath the skin of his belly with a horrible splurching sound.This former living quarters area for a forgotten ancient  
Page 23master has been taken over by the trillimite overlord who has become the egg-bearer for his tribe. According to tril-limite biology and culture, the females of the species lay small eggs in the flesh of the belly of the most corpulent male in the hive, and that male becomes the tribal overlord as the eggs grow ready to hatch beneath his skin, attended to by the trillimite egg-mothers. Because of the effects of the radiation from the reactor, this trillimite overlord is engorged to an extraordinary degree, nearly filling the room with his girth, as the egg-mothers pull six eggs from his body each hour, some ready to hatch, some deformed and rancid with radiation rot.The egg-mothers will ferociously protect the well-devel-oped eggs and the safety of the trillimite overlord, who is unable to move in his current state. But he may still reach out feebly with his tarsal claws and infect nearby enemies with radiation rot.The walls of this room feature three secret compartments, each holding an ancient relic: 1 suit of silver armor, 1 ray-rifle, and 1 plasma torch.Trillimite Egg-Mothers (3): Init +4; Atk barbed tarsal claw +4 melee (1d8+2) or deformed irradiated egg throw +3 mis-sile fire (1d6+special); AC 13; HD 3d8; hp 17 each; MV 40’; Act 1d20; SP cannot be surprised by normal means, wall-crawling, may throw up to two deformed irradiated eggs (range 30’) which cause minor corruption effects at any-thing hit by them in addition to damage dealt; SV Fort +6, Ref +3, Will +3; AL L.Trillimite Overlord: Init -5; Atk infected tarsal claw -2 me-lee (1d3+special); AC 9; HD 4d8; hp 21; MV 0’; Act 1d20; SP unable to move, but may reach out with infected tarsal claw attacks at anyone within 5’ and anyone hit by the at-tack must succeed on a Reflex save (DC = attack roll) or become inflicted with a radiation rot disease which pre-vents all normal healing during rest and requires the daily consumption of 1 greenstone shard or the victim takes 1d4 damage each night; SV Fort +3, Ref -5, Will +2; AL L.Area 4-3 – Abandoned Reactor Control Center: Green goo covers metallic panels along the walls. Eight golden, glowing runes surround a circular mirror of cracked, blackened glass.The ancient relic in this room can be used to monitor and control the reactor core in area 5-1. The trillimites explored this area when they first arrived here weeks ago, and their tampering led to some damage, resulting in feedback that killed a trillimite explorer (who was since eaten by the tril-limite outcasts). The runes around the blackened glass mirror can be used to trigger the ancient technology in this control panel in three different ways: (a) as an observation portal, (b) as an irradi-ated liquid drain, and (c) as general reactor power control. The three effects work as follows:Control PanelActivate: Rune 8Function: Rune 1 (activates observation portal), Rune 4 (acti-vates irradiated liquid drain), Rune 3 pressed twice in a row (activates general reactor power control)Deactivate: Rune 8The control panel will not respond at all until Rune 8 is pressed, at which point the runes will glow a bright blue, and it will become active. Pressing rune 1 immediately after activation will create a vision of the interior of area 5-1 on the cracked, blackened glass mirror, and the vision will rotate 360 degrees to show the viewer all sides of the room and give a full picture of what they would see inside (though it does not show the interior of the sphere where the Organon Mag-isteros remains entombed). Pressing Rune 4 immediately af-ter activation will cause a loud clanking sound below and then the sound of swiftly running water as the irradiated liquid in the tomb is drained into a reservoir below. Pressing rune 3 twice, immediately after activation, will shut down the reactor core and turn off all power to the complex, turn-ing everything dark and reducing the frenzy of the trillimite larvae.If any other runes are pressed, or if two of the different function runes are pressed without first deactivating and reactivating the relic, bluish lightning will fly out from the cracks in the blackened glass, dealing 1d12 damage to ev-eryone in the room unless they make a DC 20 Reflex save.If the reactor core is shut down, this control panel may not be activated again unless a greenstone shard is held up to the runes, transferring its power into the relic.Area 5-1 – Reactor Core: A bluish glow fills this circular room, reflecting from the shimmering water below. In the center of the room a large metallic sphere, pulsating with energy along its strange markings, atop a winged pedestal. You can feel an alien mind reaching out to you.The Organon Magisteros is imprisoned here in this “tomb” of a reactor core, trapped by the ancients to power this spe-cial energy supply. This extradimensional being of pure ge-ometry – manifesting as a display of multi-colored lights in different shapes depending on viewer alignment (see Table 1.2) – is trapped inside the metallic sphere in the center of the reactor core. If the sphere is shattered by dealing 40 points or more damage to it, the Organon Magisteros will escape im-mediately and restructure the matter in and around the area of the trillimite hive, rewriting the direction of passageways or room locations and recombining organic and inorganic materials into strange hybrids of ancient relics and insectoid creatures, leaving the PCs trapped and in need of a new way out (see Table 1-3 to determine the restructuring of the facil-ity and Table 1-4 to determine the new random encounters that emerge). If the reactor is shut down via the control panel in area 4-3, the Organon Magisteros will be able to escape after 1d10 rounds if the PCs don’t smash the sphere before then, and the matter reconstruction will take place after that.If the irradiated water in this area has been drained away via the use of the control panel in area 4-3, then the PCs may safely stand upon the pedestal or atop the sphere. Oth-erwise, even if attempts to avoid the irradiated water are made, there is a 10% chance that a PC on the pedestal will be afflicted with a greater corruption and a 70% chance that a PC on the pedestal will be afflicted with a minor corrup-tion. Only by draining the water, or avoiding contact with the sphere or the pedestal, can this be avoided.After being set free from his entombment, the Organon Mag-
Page 24isteros will telepathically communicate with the PCs via col-ors and shapes and will not directly affect the matter of their minds or bodies. He does not realize, or does not care that he has possibly trapped the PCs underground with some deadly enemies. He bathes the PCs in multi-colored lights of various geometric patterns that are beyond their compre-hension before floating up through the walls of the complex and up into space where he will teleport back to his home dimension.Table 1-2: The Organon Magisteros, Manifestation by AlignmentLawful Characters: See the Organon Magisteros as flicker-ing cubes of red, yellow, and blue. The cubes dance around each other in perfect harmony.Neutral Characters: See the Organon Magisteros as a golden orb, radiating with blue-white light in its center. It throbs like a heartbeat.Chaotic Characters: See the Organon Magisteros as a blue pyramid that shifts into an orb, and beams of light continu-ally explode from its center, shooting out spiked silver and gold cones in irregular fashion.Table 1-3: Reconfigured Passageways After Release of Organon MagisterosRoll 1d5 twice and incorporate both changes.1 The entire complex shifts 20’ underground, leaving the maw door in the steel stump buried under 20’ of wasteland and no open exit to the surface with-out substantial digging. 2 Area 4-2 switches places with area 4-3.3 The maw door connecting area 2-2 and area 2-3 be-comes replaced by a solid metal wall and no trace of a door. It would take 30 points of damage to de-stroy and reopen the passageway.4 Area 3-1 switches places with area 2-1.5 A new tunnel opens up to directly connect area 3-1 with area 5-1.Table 1-4: Random Encounters After Release of the Organon MagisterosRandom encounters on a roll of 1-5 on 1d8.
