EXT. WASTELAND - DAY

Wide open spaces of nothing. The ground is dead, the sky is dead, there is no wind. A LOW HUM slowly grows in volume.

A sad patch of grass. SCANTRON-IOWA’s robo-boot stops short of it and the low hum ceases. From out of frame, it lowers a SILVER BOWL over the grass; LIGHT escapes at the rim. It picks up the bowl and the sad patch of grass is now ASH.

SCANTRON-IOWA
Sector organics destroyed.

Scantron is an exposition-class androdroid. Its emotional support owlbot, BUBO-1, clings to his shoulder. Its partner, PBJ-14, is a non-humanoid robot built from a child’s wagon. Whenever Scantron speaks, a TICKER-TAPE TRANSCRIPT of his speech pokes out of its chest. When PBJ-1 speaks, the same happens but its tape is about to run out and has those RED STREAKS you know from the grocery store.

SCANTRON-IOWA
PBJ-14, are we clear? Do the scanning thing.

It puts the silver dome back in PBJ-14’s wagon.

PBJ-14
Scanning thing initiating.

>PBJ-14’S POV:

PBJ has a cool head’s up display. High-tech words, charts, advertising, it all makes the wasteland look a lot cooler. We see many views of the surrounding area. Scantron is labelled “scantron-iowa, exposition-class andro-droid”. Bubo-1 bears “emotional support device”. Part of the HUD is taken up with a text console that reads:

(on HUD)
YOU ARE IN AN EMPTY WASTE. THERE IS AN EXPOSITION-CLASS ANDRO-DROID HERE. THERE IS AN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT OWL HERE.
> SCAN_

(a moment later)
SCAN COMPLETE.

>ON THE TWO:

PBJ-14
Detecting unknown artifacts.

SCANTRON-IOWA
Location?

PBJ-14
(indicating with a teeny robo-arm and LASER POINTER, rotating head)
Over there.

Scantron walks to the indicated location, leaving PBJ-14 to roll slowly along behind it. Scantron kneels down to examine the artifacts. A RED SOLO CUP, a PING-PONG BALL, a HUMAN SKULL wearing a PARTY HAT, all half-buried in the dust. It picks up the skull to examine it.

> PBJ-14’S POV:

(on HUD)
YOU ARE IN AN EMPTY WASTE. THERE IS A CUP THAT IS RED HERE. THERE IS A BALL UNIT HERE. THERE IS A SKULL HERE.

(appended on HUD as Scantron walks into frame)
THERE IS AN EXPOSITION-CLASS ANDRO-DROID HERE. THERE IS AN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT OWL HERE.

> ON THE TWO:

SCANTRON-IOWA
Artifacts of the party wars.

PBJ-14
Formal exposition request: party wars?

SCANTRON-IOWA
(looking at skull)
The party wars ushered in the time of ending at the end of the time of beginning. The creators, coveting the perfect party, made pact with creatures of pure party. These are their tools, their spoor, as are we. Consult librarium file colon backslash backslash XR dot destruction dot events dot one dash A for further details.

PBJ-14
(pause, trills, beeps)
Oh yeah, party wars, that thing. Thank you. Understood.

SCANTRON-IOWA
(crushes skull, turns to PBJ-14)
You may know of the masters, but you will never understand them! No droid can. Except one.

He gently places a SUPER-GRENADE near the red cup.

SCANTRON-IOWA
Me.

It turns and walks away, taking PBJ-14’s wagon handle to pull it along and out of the explosion radius. A SPACE-BASED MASER incinerates the entire party zone. The smoke from the resulting crater forms into cartoon cloud letters reading “PARTY POOPERS”
