EXT. WASTELAND - DAY

Wide open spaces of nothing. The ground is dead, the sky is dead, there is no wind. A LOW HUM slowly grows in volume.

A sad patch of grass. SCANTRON-IOWA’s robo-boot stops short of it and the low hum ceases. From out of frame, it lowers a SILVER BOWL over the grass; LIGHT escapes at the rim. It picks up the bowl and the sad patch of grass is now ASH.

SCANTRON-IOWA
Sector organics destroyed.

Scantron is an exposition-class androdroid. Its emotional support owlbot, BUBO-1, clings to his shoulder. Its partner, PBJ-14, is a non-humanoid robot built from a child’s wagon. Whenever Scantron speaks, a TICKER-TAPE TRANSCRIPT of his speech pokes out of its chest. When PBJ-1 speaks, the same happens but its tape is about to run out and has those RED STREAKS you know from the grocery store.

BUBO-1
(whistles)

SCANTRON-IOWA
PBJ-14, are we clear? Do the scanning thing.

It puts the silver dome back in PBJ-14’s wagon.

PBJ-14
Scanning thing initiating.

>PBJ-14’S POV:

PBJ has a cool head’s up display. High-tech words, charts, advertising, it all makes the wasteland look a lot cooler. We see many views of the surrounding area. Scantron is labelled “scantron-iowa, exposition-class andro-droid”. Bubo-1 bears “emotional support device”. Part of the HUD is taken up with a text console that reads:

(on HUD)
YOU ARE IN AN EMPTY WASTE. THERE IS AN EXPOSITION-CLASS ANDRO-DROID HERE. THERE IS AN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT OWL HERE.
> SCAN_

(a moment later)
SCAN COMPLETE.

>ON THE TWO:

PBJ-14
Detecting unknown artifacts.

SCANTRON-IOWA
Location?

PBJ-14
(indicating with a teeny robo-arm and LASER POINTER, rotating head)
Over there.

Scantron walks to the indicated location, leaving PBJ-14 to roll slowly along behind it. Scantron kneels down to examine the artifacts. A RED SOLO CUP, a PING-PONG BALL, a HUMAN SKULL wearing a PARTY HAT, all half-buried in the dust. It picks up the skull to examine it.

> PBJ-14’S POV:

(on HUD)
YOU ARE IN AN EMPTY WASTE. THERE IS A CUP THAT IS RED HERE. THERE IS A BALL UNIT HERE. THERE IS A SKULL HERE.

(appended on HUD as Scantron walks into frame)
THERE IS AN EXPOSITION-CLASS ANDRO-DROID HERE. THERE IS AN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT OWL HERE.

> ON THE TWO:

SCANTRON-IOWA
Artifacts of the party wars.

PBJ-14
Formal exposition request: party wars?

SCANTRON-IOWA
(looking at skull)
The party wars ushered in the time of ending at the end of the time of beginning. The creators, coveting the perfect party, made pact with creatures of pure party. These are their tools, their spoor, as are we. Consult librarium file colon backslash backslash XR dot destruction dot events dot one dash A for further details.

PBJ-14
(pause, trills, beeps)
Oh yeah, party wars, that thing. Thank you. Understood.

SCANTRON-IOWA
(crushes skull, turns to PBJ-14)
You may know of the masters, but you will never understand them! No droid can. Except one.

He gently places a SUPER-GRENADE near the red cup.

SCANTRON-IOWA
Me.

It turns and walks away, taking PBJ-14’s wagon handle to pull it along and out of the explosion radius. A SPACE-BASED MASER incinerates the entire party zone. The smoke from the resulting crater forms into cartoon cloud letters reading “PARTY POOPERS”


>BEGIN TITLES

…as public domain scenes of destruction play intercut with fun party scenes.

The words pulse as the Party Poopers Rap begins over the
credits. The rap has a very "The Message"/Grandmaster Flash
thing going on with it.

RAPPER
(rapping)
Par-ty Poo-pers
Par-ty Poo-pers
Hey party people in the place to be!
Think you're a party pooping person with a pedigree?
Put that aside a second, maybe two or maybe three.
Cause I'm rapping' about this story's poopers and we better all agree.

>ULTRA SLOW MOTION:
An incredibly angry BRIDE, her white dress irredeemably
stained with WET POOP, is barging out of the church doors,
chasing a terrified LITTLE PENELOPE. Little Penelope runs
around the corner and hides poorly behind a bush, wrapping
her arms around her shins.

RAPPER
Penelope is a just a little girl
All alone in the girl girl girl
She didn't love her mom or even like her dad
She threw wet human doo-doo and made everybody sad.

>CLOSE UP:
Little Penelope notices the camera and smiles
warmly as her credit appears.

>AND THEN:
Grown-up PENELOPE appears briefly for her
credit. She is looking away, concerned.

>ULTRA SLOW MOTION:
INT. OFFICE CHRISTMAS PARTY - NIGHT

A late 80's office Christmas party gone wrong. MR. CHOW is
being screamed at by his BOSS in front of everyone. All the
computer monitors scroll endless loops of "DAD'S BOSS SUX!"
in the telltale Commodore 64 font. LITTLE BLAINE, whiz kid
asian stereotype, hides behind a COPY MACHINE wired to some
sort of KID INVENTION; he slips a slice of pizza into the
copy machine and plugs it in. SLICES OF PIZZA shoot out of
the copy machine, splattering against the boss and knocking
him back and down.

RAPPER
Blaine is a little man with the master plan.
I heard one of his ancestors is friends with Charlie Chan.
Kung-Fu brains in a pizza-craving fellow
But he's not part tortoise so don't call him Donatello.

>CLOSE UP:
Little Blaine looks into the camera and
gives a kawaii salute as his credit
appears.

>AND THEN:
Grown-up BLAINE, a white man in a polo
shirt, appears for his credit. He is
checking his phone. In the unclear
distance, OLD MR. CHOW hangs by a noose,
swinging, like the rumored munchkin.

>ULTRA SLOW MOTION:
An ENDLESS LIMOUSINE drives by. Each window is filled with a
disgusted face. We see LITTLE KING NUTLEY is mooning them
from LITTLE GREASY's mom's car, driving alongside.

RAPPER
King Nutley and Greasy are a hell of a pair.
One knows how to drive and the other takes all dares.
Cruising avenues is the thing they like to do.
They bother everyone who ain't inside their crew.

EXT. STREETS OF NUTLEY - NIGHT
>CLOSE UP:
LITTLE KING NUTLEY'S ACNE'D BUTTHOLE WINKS FOR HIS CREDIT.
LITTLE GREASY STARTS TO PANIC AS HIS CAR BEGINS A FRONTAL
COLLISION--

>AND THEN:
GROWN UP KING NUTLEY APPEARS FOR HIS CREDIT, LEAVING A ROSE
ON GREASY'S GRAVE.

>ULTRA SLOW MOTION
LITTLE TINY LOOKS ECSTATIC AS A GANG OF NYMPHETS BEAT THE
BLOODY SHIT OUT OF HIM WITH ANYTHING AT HAND. LITTLE SPEEDO
FLEES THE ROOM WITH HANDFULS OF STOLEN UNDERWEAR, PUSHING A
MOM DOWN A FLIGHT OF STAIRS.

RAPPER
Tiny and Speedo are the slumber party
masters.
When it comes to raiding panties, there are
no fasters
It was socially acceptable in the late
eighties.
I was paid to rap this stuff, I apologize,
ladies.

>CLOSE UP:
LITTLE TINY SMILES FOR HIS CREDIT AS A CHAIR IS BROKEN OVER
HIS HEAD. LITTLE SPEEDO SHAKES HIS HEAD WATCHING THE MOM
FALL.

>AND THEN:
TINY, SCARRED AND WEARING AN EYEPATCH, SNOOZES, DROOLING,
NEXT TO A POOL. SPEEDO IS DIVING.

>ULTRA FUCKING SLOW-MO:
PRINCIPAL SHUBUBBA yells as he pulls his hand from his
MAILBOX, which was filled with SNAPPING MOUSETRAPS. Forehead
and neck veins bulge. LITTLE VICTORIA, tomboy, watches from
inside the house, ecstatic. LITTLE RICHIE, melted-eared
little sneak, sneaks in the front door...FLAMES appear in one
of the second floor windows as the Principal looks in the
wrong direction.

EXT. PRINCIPAL SHUBUBBA'S FRONT YARD - DAY

RAPPER
Victoria and Richie Ditch,
a flammable boy and an inflammable witch.
They held a grudge and burnt it down.
And made the principal move out of town.

>CLOSE UP:
Little Victoria pumps her fist as her credit appears; Little
Richie brings his hand down closer and closer to his
lighter's flame.

>AND THEN THE SCREEN SPLITS:
On the left: Adult VICTORIA frowns at a SALAD, wearing a
dingy bathrobe.
On the right: Adult RICHIE wakes up in bed, as if from a
terrible nightmare, SALAD spread on the pillow next to him.

>END TITLES, CUT TO:

INT. PENELOPE'S BATHROOM - PRE-DAWN
Penelope is showering behind a MILDEWED SHOWER CURTAIN. On
the tiled floor near the toilet are RIPPED HOTEL SOAP
WRAPPERS. Something gummy (yams?) is mashed into the DINGY FUZZY
BATHMAT. A STINK BUG bats against a wall, stupidly, a few
times before entering the shower. Penelope YELLS and slips in
the shower.

>END TITLES

INT. BLAIR’S MOM’S CAR - AFTERNOON

BLAIR is too tall, 16.5 years old, and drove her mom’s car to school today. 1994. KING NUTLEY, 15 and fat, is in the back seat. They’re parked in the high school parking lot.

BLAIR
Ready?

KING NUTLEY
Get us behind the library.

BLAIR
You mean the other side of this parking lot?

KING NUTLEY
Behind the library. And this, track three.

He hands over a CD-R. Blair takes it, fumblingly dealing with starting the car, getting the CD-R into her DISCMAN, adjusting the CASSETTE ADAPTER. Industrial music plays.

KING NUTLEY
Track three, Blair.

Track three is indistinguishable industrial music.
